      "4.\tIn this regard, it would be highly appreciated if Your Excellency could kindly use your good offices to lend special support to the ECOWAS Radio by calling on our colleague Heads of States to give appropriate directives to their National Broadcasting Stations to develop cooperation with the ECOWAS Radio through frequency allocations, sharing of programmes as well as encouraging the National News Agency of Member-States to feed their programmes to the ECOWAS Radio.\n",

      "I am pleased to have been invited to make the Opening Remarks by the organizers of this Stakeholders Conference on Home-Grown School Feeding.  This is because my Government not only recognizes the importance of education for our children, but is also concerned about the need to ensure food security and nutrition for the Liberian people.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I am therefore delighted that you are gathered here today to map out and deliberate on the framework of support that should actualize these concerns through a number of flagship initiatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "This Conference, under the theme “Grow at home, eat at School to Change and Save Lives” could not have happened at a better moment, as we this week celebrate the 171st Independence Anniversary of the founding of Liberia, and the first such celebration under my Administration. \n",
      "\n",
      "The conference is also timely because the concept of the Home-Grown School Feeding is fully aligned to our national development blue-print; known as the Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, Home-Grown School Feeding contributes to the eventual realization of a number of Sustainable Development Goals, such as those which call for ending poverty and hunger; improving nutrition for good health and well-being; the provision of quality education for our children, and the empowerment of girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea of feeding in school plays two essential roles in our society: it serves as a motivator and encouragement for children to attend classes; and at the same time nourishes the brain to perform at its highest levels of cognition.  It also helps to reduce the high mal-nourishment amongst school-age children, and improves their learning abilities. \n",
      "\n",
      "Feeding in our school system is not a new idea.  Before the Liberian Civil Conflict, most public schools benefited from the Care Food Program which was initiated by the Government of Liberia.  Again, in the early 1990s, the UN re-introduced the concept of feeding in schools, but that effort was short lived. \n",
      "\n",
      "The previous school feeding programs in Liberia were unsustainable because of the high financial costs associated with the importation of the basic foods used in them.   \n",
      "Now, with the introduction of this new home-grown concept, which allows local farmers to produce the bulk of the food, costs will be lower, and the local farmers will be financially better off by having a secure market for their products, as they become an integral part of the food supply chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will increase their agricultural output and thereby increase their income.  All of these new variables, working together, should ensure that a home-grown feeding program is both cost-effective and sustainable.\n",
      "\n",
      "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\n",
      "\n",
      "I would like to encourage all the stakeholders present today, and, in particular, the development partners, to provide all possible support within your means to this initiative.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The potential that the Home-Grown School Feeding has in lifting our people out of poverty, and availing to them new livelihood and developmental opportunities -- not only to our farmers -- but also enhancing better educational results to our students, cannot be over-emphasized. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I am aware that some of the partners have already expressed interest in supporting this initiative. I would like to thank you for the interest so far and encourage you and others to concretize your efforts in this regard. \n",
      "\n",
      "In closing, I want to assure you that this program has my personal support, because of the great potential that it holds for education, agriculture, and transformation of our economy. \n",
      "I would like to congratulate the parties to this initiative, and call upon all stakeholders to strongly support it.  Because, through its implementation, we have an opportunity to better the future of our children, and improve the quality of life of our local farmers. \n",
      "\n",
      "AND NOW, ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBERIA, I DECLARE THIS CONFERENCE OFFICIALLY OPEN.  I PRAY THAT YOUR DELIBERATIONS WILL BE FRUITFUL, FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THE LIBERIA PEOPLE.\n",

      "With deep regret and profound sorrow, it is my duty to inform you of a major national tragedy which befell our country on last week Wednesday night, January 19, 2022, in which 29 Liberians died and many more were wounded in a stampede which occurred during a religious crusade in New Kru Town on Bushrod Island in Monrovia.\n",

      "I am informed by the authorities that those who died included 18 adults (16 females, including 1 pregnant woman, and 2 males), and 11 children (6 girls and 5 boys).  Of the 15 persons who were seriously wounded, there were 7 children and 8 adults. \n",
      "\n",
      "May I now ask you to rise on your feet and remain standing, in remembrance, respect, and honor for those who have lost their lives in this terrible disaster. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have declared a 3-day State of National Mourning, and have ordered that the national ensign be flown at half-mast at all public buildings throughout the Republic while the Nation mourns.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have also mandated the Liberia National Police to conduct a full-scale, thorough, and speedy investigation to ascertain whether or not there is criminal culpability, and have met with the religious leadership and pastors of the Christian community to discuss ways to safeguard their congregations at mass events such as rallies and crusades in order to prevent a re-occurrence of this tragedy. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have also called on health authorities, including the Liberian National Red Cross and the Disaster Management Agency, to assist with treatment and recovery efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have personally visited the scene of the disaster and met with some of the survivors, and have also led an array of officials of Government to visit the wounded in hospital.  \n",

      "Let us now convey our deepest sympathies to the families of the bereaved, while expressing our gratitude to all those who provided help to the victims in the immediate aftermath of the stampede.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worthy to note that the Government has received dozens of messages of sympathy and condolence from the leaders and governments of many countries and international organizations, all of whom have expressed their solidarity with Liberia in our time of grief.  In return, other countries which have recently experienced similar disasters, especially those in our sub-region, have received messages of sympathy and condolences from our Government.\n",

      "Let me now welcome you back from your Annual Recess as you begin this Fifth Session of constructive dialogue and deliberation in the supreme interest of the Liberian people. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to this Honorable Body for your constant and consistent support to our legislative program.  I look forward to working with you during this Fifth Session, in the usual spirit of collaboration and cooperation that we have always enjoyed. \n",
      "\n",
      "During the period under review, our collaborative efforts have resulted in your passage, and subsequent approval by me, of twenty-three (23) pieces of legislation, which include financing agreements, creation of regional universities, and ratification of international instruments, amongst others.  These laws, most especially the financing agreements, have important implications for the growth and development of the Liberian economy. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While I applaud you for your hard work, I want to respectfully remind you that there are still thirty-five (35) pieces of legislation which are pending before you, eight (8) of them from your Third Session of 2020, and twenty-seven (27) of them from your Fourth Session of 2021\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of these proposed laws have important significance to strengthening our governance and judiciary systems, as well as our relationships within our sub-region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Others, when enacted by you, will help to ensure and secure financial transactions in support of our monetary and fiscal policies, and will help to prevent our country from being a conduit of illicit financial transactions, money laundering, and terrorist financing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Taken together, these pending bills constitute a major proportion of our legislative agenda for the ensuing year, although we will be submitting new bills during this Fifth Session for your further consideration.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In the interest of time, a detailed list of the 23 bills passed during your Fourth Session, together with the 35 pending bills presently before you, as well as the three Executive Orders signed by me during the period under review, are attached as an Appendix to this Annual Message.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE 54TH LEGISLATURE:\n",
      "\n",
      "We are counting on you to consider the expeditious passage of these pending bills, as well as the other new bills which we will be submitting to you for your timely consideration during this Fifth Session.  It is our fervent hope that we will continue to work together collaboratively, in the best interest of the Liberian People, to timeously execute our Constitutional duties.\n",

      "MR. SPEAKER:\n",
      "\n",
      "Two hundred years ago, some of our forebears returned to our shores, after enduring four centuries of bondage in slavery, and helped to found the Republic of Liberia. \n",
      "\n",
      "As I said during my remarks at the Kick-Off program held this month on Providence Island to commemorate the day that the settlers landed here, we must redouble our efforts to promote unity amongst all Liberians worldwide, and encourage all to make meaningful contributions to the nation-building task of our country. For ...\"in union strong, success is sure. We cannot fail...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We therefore would like to commend the Honorable Supreme Court for its Opinion handed down on the Twenty-Third of December 2019, which found that certain provisions of the Alien and Nationality Law are inconsistent with the Constitution of Liberia.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, the current Alien and Nationality Law provides that a natural-born Liberian citizen automatically loses his or her citizenship, without any due process of law in a court in Liberia, upon taking up citizenship of another country or acting in some capacity for that country. This law undermines our quest for unity amongst all Liberians - everywhere! \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, as we celebrate the Bicentennial anniversary of the founding of our country, I want to call on the Honorable Members of this 54th Legislature, in particular the Liberian Senate, to consider passage of the Bill currently before you, which seeks to codify the Opinion of the Honorable Supreme Court and make it  more true that ...  \"once a Liberian - always a Liberian.\"\n",

      "Our Constitution places upon me the solemn responsibility to report on the State of the Republic, with specific mention of public expenditure and national income. \n",
      "\n",
      "Revenue collection for 2021, including grants, was $646 million U.S. dollars, compared to $653.9 million U.S. dollars in 2020.  This apparent decrease is attributable to more international Covid-related funding that was received in Calendar Year 2020.  This revenue performance was driven by higher receipts of tax and non-tax revenues, especially taxes on international trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of this amount, domestic taxes was $577 million U.S. dollars and external resources received from our Development Partners was  $68 million U.S. dollars. The last fiscal year recorded the highest level of domestic revenue performance since the end of the civil conflict.  We are all encouraged and challenged to sustain these efforts. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, total cash expenditure for the same period under review was $668 million U.S. dollars.

      "As part of my vision to ensure sustainable fiscal and developmental decentralization of the resources of the Republic, I embarked on a nation-wide county tour in 2021. \n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of the tour was to engage the citizens of our noble country directly; to listen to them; to see, feel, and to understand their plights; while gathering valuable input from them in terms of their collective direction for our country.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Speaker, during the tour, I visited and held town hall meetings in about 70 districts in 14 of the 15 counties.  Very shortly in the coming weeks I will complete my County tour with Montserrado County.   Traveling to and sleeping in those districts, towns and villages, showed me the chronic level of underdevelopment being endured by our people that are living in rural Liberia since the founding of our great nation 200 years ago. \n",
      "\n",
      "I saw abject poverty and the lack of development across our country, which are characterized by bad roads, lack of schools and hospitals; lack of market buildings to shelter our mothers and sisters from the open elements of the rain and sun; lack of centers for the youth, women and the disabled to enrich their capacity-building efforts; the lack of housing; and the lack of financial resources to strengthen the economic capabilities of our people. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in the midst of the glaring underdevelopment across our rural counties, I also saw the hope and the golden opportunities of our beautiful country. \n",
      "\n",
      "The County Tour has therefore inspired in me a fierce urgency to meaningfully intervene to narrow the developmental gaps and increase the socio-economic opportunities for our people in these counties. \n",
      "\n",
      "After holding various town hall meetings and receiving hundreds of petitions from the citizens of our rural counties, I have committed to undertaking more than 400 impactful  projects within the counties to decentralize and broaden the development of our country. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "MR SPEAKER:\n",
      "\n",
      "In that regard, I am pleased to inform you that since I embarked on the County Tour in February 2021, we have not only started, but have actually completed a number of projects. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have provided 3,600 solar streetlights in 22 cities and districts in 12 of our counties that were in darkness. Solar farms and dams are being constructed to provide more electricity to our rural counties. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have also completed a 100- bed modern hospital in Bopolu City, Gbarpolu County, and another 100-bed hospital in Gbediah, Rivercess County.  Other clinics are being constructed around the country to modernize and enhance our healthcare delivery system.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, I authorized the disbursement of $2 million US dollars under the Liberia Agency for Community Empowerment (LACE) to kick-start about 17 projects. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also authorized funding to the Ministry of Public Works to begin the pavement of roads, construction of bridges and the layout of major city streets within our rural counties. \n",
      "\n",
      "To support our farmers, $16 million US dollars was allocated through our development partners to our local farmers, \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, I have proposed $2 million dollars in the 2022 national budget to provide business loans to our small women-owned businesses as a way of reducing poverty through the private sector. I will also be submitting a bill to you this year to enact this business loan scheme into law for its sustainability. \n",

Exploiting every opportunity to enhance our country’s development must be a collective effort from all Liberians, irrespective of our political, religious and social differences.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is why I have proposed more than $25 million US dollars in the 2022 national budget under the County Tour framework to address the roads, housing, schools, hospitals and all social development needs of our dear country, most especially the rural counties. This consists of $10 million US dollars to directly support County Tour Projects.

Tomorrow, January 25, 2022, at 12:00 noon, there will be a Ceremony held at the SKD Stadium where I will be presenting items to the Traditional Leaders of each of the 15 counties to enable and empower them to reach out to their People.\n",

      "We are making steady progress in the electricity sector, but strong challenges remain.  Since 2018 total households connected to the electricity grid has increased by more than 260 percent, from more than 49,000 customers in 2018 to about 130,000 customers by December of 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "New investments in transformers, meters and delivery of new sub-stations are all contributing to changing the electricity landscape. The Government was also able to provide more than 10,000 street lights in Monrovia and around the country, and under the current budget more street lights, including solar lights are going to be provided. \n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SPEAKER:  \n",

      "I am proud to report that the cost of electricity, a major challenge for businesses and households, has been reduced from 35 cents per kilowatt hour to around 24 cents per kilowatt hour for    residential customers and to 22 cents per kilowatt hour for businesses. While at 22 cents, this tariff is still higher in the West African sub-region, it is a massive development for the electricity sector in Liberia.\n",

      "The Millennium Challenge Compact signed between the Government of Liberia and the Government of the United States of America came to an end on January 21, 2021 after 5 years of implementation. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Compact provided a grant of $257 million U.S. dollars for the electricity and road sectors. The Compact also contributed $147 million US dollars to the rehabilitation of Mt. Coffee Hydro Power Plant and the increase of connections from 34,000 customers to over 82,000. The Liberia Electricity Regulatory Commission was also established under the Compact which is now empowered to license private operators in the electricity sector. \n",

      "Additionally, an $18 million U.S. dollars raw water pipeline was constructed which has led to savings of $780,000 U. S. dollars  annually on pumping costs. These are only but a few of the projects covered under the Compact. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "During my last address to this Honorable Legislature, I informed you that agricultural productivity would be a key priority of this Administration. The year in review saw several new beginnings and milestones for the agricultural sector. Private sector interest and investment in agriculture grew heavily , especially after the holding of the National Agriculture Fair in February, 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fair highlighted Liberian agricultural productivity, and while outlining the challenges faced by producers and agribusinesses, it also presented the abundant opportunities in agriculture and agribusiness. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I can proudly report to you that the number of commercial farms and agribusinesses more than significantly increased from 77 in 2021 to 164 in 2022, while there are now dealerships of agricultural machinery, complete with spare parts and workshops. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a positive development for the efforts to mechanize Liberian farm production, and is a natural next step to the Government of Liberia’s own efforts through the Ministry of Agriculture, to provide tools, equipment, seeds, seedlings to farmers, farming communities and cooperatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interventions we made as a Government have led to increased acres planted in most crops, but especially so for basic foods like rice, cassava, oil palm and vegetables.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the country moved into harvest season towards the end of the year, bumper crops are reaching rural and urban markets, due to improvements in the logistics and supportive infrastructure that we have provided for agriculture.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Dedicated warehouses for cocoa producers were constructed and/or rehabilitated in Nimba, Lofa and Bong counties; while processing plants for palm oil were built in Grand Bassa, Bong and Lofa counties. Rice processing plants in Lofa county were finalized in time to process the massive harvests coming in from expanded farms. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Ministry of Agriculture developed and negotiated and signed, along with the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning,  key new projects valued at over $73 million US dollars.  The World Bank’s Rural Economy Transformation Project, (RETRAP), which is meant to expand the ongoing Smallholder Transformation and Agribusiness Revitalization Project, STAR-P, was developed for a total value of $55 million US dollars. \n",
      "\n",
      "The RETRAP will oversee the paving of the road from Tappita in Nimba County to Toe Town in Grand Gedeh County, completing a vital portion of the Ganta-Harper Highway that is already ongoing. \n",
      "\n",
      "This major piece of road construction will, by next year, see the paving of the road going into neighboring Côte d’Ivoire, and will facilitate the free movement of goods, passengers and services in the sub-region. In addition, the RETRAP will drive resources into the rubber, cassava, poultry and piggery sectors to complement other projects in rice, oil palm and vegetables. \n",
      "\n",

      "The Rural Community Financing Project implemented in collaboration with the Central Bank of Liberia and the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, having been impacted by COVID-19-induced lock-downs and the closure of several banks in rural areas, was successful in getting eleven (11) Rural Community Financing Institutions more operational.\n",
      "A key part of the transformation of Liberian agriculture involves the engagement with the Private Sector. In 2021, the Nimba Rubber Corporation began exporting processed rubber from Liberia, including processing rubber from private farms for export markets. This represents a fundamental shift towards industrializing Liberia’s oldest commercial agricultural sector.\n",
      "Also in 2021, the Atlantic Cocoa Corporation exported the first containers of certified organic cocoa from Liberia. While Liberia’s cocoa production lags behind production giants in the region, Liberian cocoa continues to win awards and prizes in international competitions for its exceptional quality. My administration is therefore promoting and working to provide the enabling environment for high quality production of cash and food crops. \n",
      "The Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industry in Liberia is growing exponentially, especially with the establishment and growth of light industries. In this regard, the award-winning J-Palm \n",
      "Corporation with its Kernel Fresh products made from Liberian palm kernels stands out as an example of Liberian entrepreneurship excellence.\n",
      "Several companies and agro-processors in the cassava sector, arguably Liberia’s largest agriculture sector, also stand out for their outstanding supply of gari and fufu flour to national food reserves for re-distribution during the COVID-19 emergency. \n",

      "These achievements and interventions include the development of continuous learning platforms and smart classrooms throughout the country, and the introduction of a distant learning framework along with virtual laboratories.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am also pleased to report that we have made the largest single investment in Senior Secondary School since the 1970s to address the huge infrastructure deficit in the education sector. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A $47 million US dollar grant received from the World Bank with a wide scope of interventions including new construction, rehabilitation, equipping training, and text books development has greatly contributed to the huge push we are making to fix the mess in the educational system.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am also pleased to report on the following deliverables in Education:\n",
      "\n",
      "Renovation and rehabilitation of all 156 Public Senior Secondary Schools throughout the Country are ongoing simultaneously. As of June 2022, it is expected that all renovations works would have been completed and dedication shall be planned in phases, preferably by county.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the IRISE Project and in partnership with the World Bank, we will begin the construction of three Model High School complexes in the first quarter of this year now that design and procurement requirements have been completed.  Each of the three institutions has been designed to accommodate 1,500 Senior High School students. My government will replicate this in other school districts to provide a better learning environment for our children. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SPEAKER:\n",
      "\n",
      "Available school statistics have it that the total number of senior secondary schools in the country is 752 as of Academic 2020 / 2021, of which, the Government owns only 156.  To reduce that gap, the IRISE Project shall fund the construction of 25 new Secondary Schools strategically situated in 25 school districts that are currently without secondary schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under this project, we are also funding the training of 35 University instructors out of the country, procuring a digital library, revising textbooks for students and upgrading curriculum. Additionally, in an effort to address the gaps in girl education, we will provide scholarship financial support for 3,000 Girls transitioning from 9th grade in 4 counties considered as having the highest rates of Girls dropout from High School. As there are no tuitions in Public Schools, sponsorship shall cover all registration fees, uniforms, text books, and annual cash allowances.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Liberia to develop, we must develop the minds of our youths. We must train our teachers so that they themselves will be able to train the minds of our youths. During the period under review, curriculum training was provided to 1,250 teachers and caregivers who have since returned to their places of assignment in Sinoe, Maryland, Grand Kru, Rivercess, River Gee & Bomi. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Major strides and inroads have also been made in technical and vocational education and training. The TVET projects include a major rehabilitation and construction of training centers in six of the 15 counties of Liberia. Additionally, an initial number of 76 TVET teachers have been sent abroad for training to support TVET institutions in Liberia upon their return. \n",
      "\n",
      "A number of them will be Master Trainers with assignment at the Booker Washington Institute, which is being scaled up to a TVET Teacher Training Institution for the future. The total number of teachers for this purpose, will be 120, of which 76 have been hired and are in training, while the reminder 44 are being recruited for subsequent training.   \n",

      " MR. SPEAKER:\n",
      "\n",
      "The largest single spender for education is the Government. For the budget period 2020 / 2021 the government appropriated US$79.4M US dollars out of a budget of US$570.1M million US dollars, which amounts to a 14 percent share of the national budget going to education. The total appropriation which covers all education expenditures for the year, was sub-allocated such that Basic, Secondary  and Early Childhood Subdivision of education received US$41.8M or 52,64 percent of our budget.\n",

      "\n",
      "As a Government, one of our priorities is to reduce the incidence of sexual and gender based violence by 30 percent by 2023, through the provision of appropriate support services and access to justice systems. I am pleased to report that significant progress is being made to make this a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the emergence of the COVID-19 when most women and girls were confined in their homes, there was a steep increase in the reporting of sexual and gender-based violence cases due to the heightened awareness that we conducted in communities and at the grass-root level. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, we saw a reduction in Sexual and Gender Based Violence cases in December of 2021, compared to the reports of 2020 December. We have been able to raise awareness among communities about the referral systems, the government’s anti-Sexual and Gender Based Violence Call Center and can ensure its functionality. \n",
      "\n",
      "Traditional and religious leaders are also beefing up the efforts to change the story and narratives of survivors and victims, as well as supporting prevention efforts of sexual and gender-based violence. While we all may be aware that \"prevention is better than cure\", we will continue to work with our UN counterparts, \n",
      "INGOs, NGOs, and civil society organizations to increase efforts in preventing sexual and gender-based violence. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, we are also concerned about our response to sexual and gender-based violence, which prompted the setting up of the Presidential Taskforce on Sexual and Gender Based Violence through the implementation of the \"Government of Liberia and Partner's Anti-Sexual and Gender Based Violence Roadmap 2020-2022\".\n",
      "\n",
      "My Government has been able to procure DNA machines to aid in evidence gathering of related sexual and gender-based violence cases.  This will bring relief and justice to both survivors and alleged perpetrators during the legal proceedings of Sexual and Gender Based Violence  cases at the level of the court. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have made interventions in rehabilitation of safe homes and one-stop centers, including in River Gee and Grand Cape Mount Counties, as well as other safe spaces for children. My  Government will continue to ensure that no perpetrators shall go unpunished. \n",

      "\n",
      "Based on the economic crisis posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we expanded the beneficiary pool with support from the Foreign Commonwealth Development Office (UKAID) and the World Bank. An additional 15,000 households within Urban Montserrado County were enrolled and benefitted– making a greater impact in the lives of 18,300 beneficiaries in three counties, with 82 percent of the beneficiaries being females and 27 percent being males. \n",
      "\n",
      "Phase Two of the program has been launched to add an additional 6,500 households by the end of March 2022. To establish the basic building blocks for social protection and an equitable and objective process to the distribution of our limited resources, the Liberian Household Social Registry under the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection is well on its way with 233,000 Households profiled across five (5) counties -- Bomi, Bong, Nimba, Maryland and Montserrado.

      "It provides an in-depth analysis, that will enhance the understanding of the differences in the conditions, needs, participation rates, access to resources and property rights, development planning and control of assets, decision-making powers between girls, women, boys and men in their assigned gender roles.\n",

      "During the period under review, the government and its partners implemented several programs intended to improve the lives of the country's youths. This is a sector that is central to every program meant to empower ordinary people. The young people of Liberia have already gone through quite a lot. While many have advanced to the next stage of their lives, others need our push.\n",

      "Amongst the many programs we have initiated to improve living condition for young people is the Youth Entrepreneurship and Empowerment Program (YEEP), a $2.4 million US dollar initiative funded by the African Development Bank, to get graduating students work-ready. We also are implementing the \n",
      "Entrepreneurship Development program; the Liberian Employment and Entrepreneurship Program (LEEP) and the recently launched Recovery of Economic Activities for Liberia Informal Sector Employment (REALISE), which will provide short-term employment opportunities to a much wider demographic, including young people.\n",

      "The European Union (EU) has approved additional 26 million Euros to cover the cost of establishing state-of-the-art TVET schools in the rest of the 8 Counties that do not have them.  This is in fulfilment of our vision to have TVET Institutions in all 15 Counties.\n",
      "\n",
      "These initiatives are targeted at all Liberian youth, regardless of which county they may reside in. Thousands have already benefitted.

We were challenged to seek high office because of the serious and seemingly entrenched nature of the governance and socio-economic problems of this country that were very obvious to everyone.  And we were further challenged by the opportunity that you have given us to address and eventually solve them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Surely, we faced some major challenges in the last four years, but as a Government and as a People, we have emerged stronger. The challenges may have tried to derail and distract us,  but they did not prevent us from continuing the work of national development. \n",

      "Today, four years on, we continue to protect the peace and security of our people, to build more roads, transform electricity, build new hospitals and improve the quality of care, transform the challenging situation in education, build more markets for our market women around the country, and work toward improving governance and accountability for public resources. \n",
      "\n",
      "While the challenges are many, our recent macroeconomic crisis and the current COVID-19 crisis have taught us that when we are united, we can solve any problem.

      "With deep regret and profound sorrow, it is my duty to inform you of a major national tragedy which befell our country on last week Wednesday night, January 19, 2022, in which 29 Liberians died and many more were wounded in a stampede which occurred during a religious crusade in New Kru Town on Bushrod Island in Monrovia.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have also mandated the Liberia National Police to conduct a full-scale, thorough, and speedy investigation to ascertain whether or not there is criminal culpability, and have met with the religious leadership and pastors of the Christian community to discuss ways to safeguard their congregations at mass events such as rallies and crusades in order to prevent a re-occurrence of this tragedy. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have also called on health authorities, including the Liberian National Red Cross and the Disaster Management Agency, to assist with treatment and recovery efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have personally visited the scene of the disaster and met with some of the survivors, and have also led an array of officials of Government to visit the wounded in hospital.  \n",

      "Let us now convey our deepest sympathies to the families of the bereaved, while expressing our gratitude to all those who provided help to the victims in the immediate aftermath of the stampede.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worthy to note that the Government has received dozens of messages of sympathy and condolence from the leaders and governments of many countries and international organizations, all of whom have expressed their solidarity with Liberia in our time of grief.  In return, other countries which have recently experienced similar disasters, especially those in our sub-region, have received messages of sympathy and condolences from our Government.\n",

I would also like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to this Honorable Body for your constant and consistent support to our legislative program.  I look forward to working with you during this Fifth Session, in the usual spirit of collaboration and cooperation that we have always enjoyed. \n",
      "\n",
      "During the period under review, our collaborative efforts have resulted in your passage, and subsequent approval by me, of twenty-three (23) pieces of legislation, which include financing agreements, creation of regional universities, and ratification of international instruments, amongst others.  These laws, most especially the financing agreements, have important implications for the growth and development of the Liberian economy. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While I applaud you for your hard work, I want to respectfully remind you that there are still thirty-five (35) pieces of legislation which are pending before you, eight (8) of them from your Third Session of 2020, and twenty-seven (27) of them from your Fourth Session of 2021\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of these proposed laws have important significance to strengthening our governance and judiciary systems, as well as our relationships within our sub-region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Others, when enacted by you, will help to ensure and secure financial transactions in support of our monetary and fiscal policies, and will help to prevent our country from being a conduit of illicit financial transactions, money laundering, and terrorist financing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Taken together, these pending bills constitute a major proportion of our legislative agenda for the ensuing year, although we will be submitting new bills during this Fifth Session for your further consideration.  \n",

      "\n",
      "We are counting on you to consider the expeditious passage of these pending bills, as well as the other new bills which we will be submitting to you for your timely consideration during this Fifth Session.  It is our fervent hope that we will continue to work together collaboratively, in the best interest of the Liberian People, to timeously execute our Constitutional duties.\n",

      "Two hundred years ago, some of our forebears returned to our shores, after enduring four centuries of bondage in slavery, and helped to found the Republic of Liberia. \n",
      "\n",
      "As I said during my remarks at the Kick-Off program held this month on Providence Island to commemorate the day that the settlers landed here, we must redouble our efforts to promote unity amongst all Liberians worldwide, and encourage all to make meaningful contributions to the nation-building task of our country. For ...\"in union strong, success is sure. We cannot fail...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We therefore would like to commend the Honorable Supreme Court for its Opinion handed down on the Twenty-Third of December 2019, which found that certain provisions of the Alien and Nationality Law are inconsistent with the Constitution of Liberia.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, the current Alien and Nationality Law provides that a natural-born Liberian citizen automatically loses his or her citizenship, without any due process of law in a court in Liberia, upon taking up citizenship of another country or acting in some capacity for that country. This law undermines our quest for unity amongst all Liberians - everywhere! \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, as we celebrate the Bicentennial anniversary of the founding of our country, I want to call on the Honorable Members of this 54th Legislature, in particular the Liberian Senate, to consider passage of the Bill currently before you, which seeks to codify the Opinion of the Honorable Supreme Court and make it  more true that ...  \"once a Liberian - always a Liberian.\"\n",

      "Our Constitution places upon me the solemn responsibility to report on the State of the Republic, with specific mention of public expenditure and national income. \n",
      "\n",
      "Revenue collection for 2021, including grants, was $646 million U.S. dollars, compared to $653.9 million U.S. dollars in 2020.  This apparent decrease is attributable to more international Covid-related funding that was received in Calendar Year 2020.  This revenue performance was driven by higher receipts of tax and non-tax revenues, especially taxes on international trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of this amount, domestic taxes was $577 million U.S. dollars and external resources received from our Development Partners was  $68 million U.S. dollars. The last fiscal year recorded the highest level of domestic revenue performance since the end of the civil conflict.  We are all encouraged and challenged to sustain these efforts. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, total cash expenditure for the same period under review was $668 million U.S. dollars.  Of this amount, 44 percent was spent on compensation of Government employees, 25 percent on  goods and services, 17 percent on domestic and international debt, and 5 percent on Public Sector Investment. \n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SPEAKER:\n",
      "\n",
      "For at least the last five decades, Liberia has had a fiscal year that runs from July 1 to June 30. Liberia has been the only country in the ECOWAS sub-region that has run this fiscal year, which is out of alignment with the rest of the countries in the region.  We have  been encouraged by ECOWAS for nearly two decades now since the end of the civil war to revise our fiscal calendar.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Speaker I am proud to report that the change has finally taken place, and the year 2022 will be the first fiscal year that is also a calendar year for the national budget and other instruments and processes of the Government.  \n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SPEAKER:\n",
      "\n",
      "To facilitate this transition, we had to enact a special transitional budget which you approved at $347.9 million US dollars in the year under review.   December 31, 2021 concluded this transitional budget, which was funded exclusively by domestic revenue, and the draft national budget is presently before the House of Senate for consideration, having been passed by the House of Representatives. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SPEAKER AND MEMBERS OF THE 54TH LEGISLATURE:\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2022 budget was passed by the House at $785.6 million U.S. dollars. This is the largest national budget in the history of Liberia,  and with the support of the National Legislature we hope to make it the most transformative.  Domestic revenue is projected at $640.5 million US dollars, or 81.5 percent, while external resources are projected at $145 million US dollars, or 18.5 percent.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We have increased capital spending in the proposed Fiscal Year 2022 budget. In response to the need for more development, we are putting more resources to solving the many development challenges confronting our people in various sectors. \n",
      "\n",
      "These capital investments will cover roads, electricity, education, national security, health, water and sanitation, transport and several other sectors. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am thankful that the House of Representatives approved $10 million U.S. dollars for projects under the County Tour that I undertook in the year under review. These county tour projects will bring serious relief to many of our people, especially those in rural areas.\n",

      "\n",
      "It is very clear that the success of this budget depends on strong revenue measures. It depends on all citizens paying their lawful taxes and doing so in a timely manner. In this regard, the Government in 2022 will support even more vigorously the domestic resource mobilization strategy of the Liberia Revenue Authority. \n",
      "\n",
      "Government, through the LPRA, has launched a program to keep 50 percent of all real estate taxes collected back to the counties, districts and cities where the real estate taxes are collected. This is a measure to boost real estate taxes by involving local communities and their residents, as well as ensure that part of the money stays at the local level, in keeping with the Decentralization Law that was recently passed under my Administration. The program is being piloted in Margibi County. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "MR. SPEAKER:\n",
      "\n",
      "We are working with the National Legislature to limit tax waivers or tax expenditures, which in the last three years alone have cost us more than $300 million U.S. dollars. While duty-free privileges and incentives are important to spur development, I believe that, as a country, we have been too generous with these instruments and must now begin to take a more conservative approach.\n",

      "We have made significant progress in restructuring our domestic debt. All legacy debts owed the Central Bank of Liberia, including the debt owed to the former National Bank of Liberia, were bundled into a Restructured and Consolidated Loan at the start of the IMF-supported program two years ago. This Restructured Loan totaled $487.5 million U.S. dollars. The Government pays an annual interest of $13.9 million U.S. dollars to the Central Bank of Liberia on this loan and will start to pay principal in the year 2030.\n",
      "\n",
      "The total stock of domestic debt now stands at $660 million U.S.  dollars and the total stock of external debt now stands at approximately $1.03 billion U.S. dollars for a total public debt stock valued at $1.69 billion U.S. dollars as at December 31, 2021.\n",
      "  \n",
      "The total debt stock grew by 6.29 percent compared to end-December 2020 debt stock of $1.59 billion U.S. dollars and this growth was from disbursement on both external and domestic loans. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On both domestic and external debt the Government paid the amount of $83.4 million U.S. dollars  in debt service. Of this amount, $62.8 million U.S. dollars was paid for domestic debt to the Central Bank of Liberia, to commercial banks for Treasury Bonds, and to other institutions, while $20.6 million U.S. dollars was paid to multilateral and bilateral partners. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Treasury Bonds, which were issued by the previous Government in 2013, are costing the Government more than $6 million U.S. dollars in interest annually, just to roll them over to the next period.  This is a legacy debt which my Administration inherited.  However, in the interest of continuity of Government, it is an obligation that we have to pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I am pleased to inform you that, working with the IMF, we have allocated $35 million U.S. dollars to completely redeem these very expensive Treasury Bonds.  This will free up space for investment in education, healthcare and other important priority areas. \n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SPEAKER:\n",
      "\n",
      "We are almost at the point where the audit of the consolidated revenue account will be current up to any fiscal year.  In 2018 my Administration inherited an audit backlog dating back to the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 national budgets. We have worked overtime to conduct these audits and make current the audit of the consolidated revenue account. \n",
      "\n",
      "With  the completion of the Fiscal Year 2019/2020 audit, we are making good progress.  The General Auditing Commission is presently conducting an independent payroll audit funded by the World Bank, and is developing a new framework to ensure better audits and financial reporting that is consistent with the Public Financial Management Law.\n",

      "We must continue to show strong gains in the fight against corruption, money laundering and illicit financial flows. The Government is strengthening and empowering the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission to prevent fraud and acts of corruption before they occur.  You will be aware that the House has already passed the new LACC Act giving a broader mandate to the LACC to fight corruption.   It is my hope that, in the supreme interest of the Liberian People, the Senate will soon concur. \n",
      "\n",
      "The House has also passed the new anti-money-laundering legislation, which empowers the Financial Intelligence Unit to fight illicit financial flows, such as money laundering, and drug and terrorist financing.  We will spare no effort to bring Liberia within international compliance in the fight against corruption and illicit financial flows. \n",

      "MR. SPEAKER:\n",

      "With your support our Administration continues to implement several reforms on the Central Government payroll and pension schemes. For example, we have successfully placed all Government workers on biometric ID; reduced non-contributory pension scheme from about 17,000 pensioners in 2017 to about 6,000 pensioners to date; expanded social security coverage and increased social security contribution by 300 percent in some instances. \n",

      "In that regard, I am pleased to inform you that since I embarked on the County Tour in February 2021, we have not only started, but have actually completed a number of projects. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have provided 3,600 solar streetlights in 22 cities and districts in 12 of our counties that were in darkness. Solar farms and dams are being constructed to provide more electricity to our rural counties. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have also completed a 100- bed modern hospital in Bopolu City, Gbarpolu County, and another 100-bed hospital in Gbediah, Rivercess County.  Other clinics are being constructed around the country to modernize and enhance our healthcare delivery system.\n",

      "To support our farmers, $16 million US dollars was allocated through our development partners to our local farmers, \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, I have proposed $2 million dollars in the 2022 national budget to provide business loans to our small women-owned businesses as a way of reducing poverty through the private sector.

Exploiting every opportunity to enhance our country’s development must be a collective effort from all Liberians, irrespective of our political, religious and social differences.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is why I have proposed more than $25 million US dollars in the 2022 national budget under the County Tour framework to address the roads, housing, schools, hospitals and all social development needs of our dear country, most especially the rural counties. This consists of $10 million US dollars to directly support County Tour Projects.

      "I have decided to address this issue with urgency and with decisive action.  Tomorrow, January 25, 2022, at 12:00 noon, there will be a Ceremony held at the SKD Stadium where I will be presenting items to the Traditional Leaders of each of the 15 counties to enable and empower them to reach out to their People.\n",

      "During my last address to this Honorable Legislature, I informed you that agricultural productivity would be a key priority of this Administration. The year in review saw several new beginnings and milestones for the agricultural sector. Private sector interest and investment in agriculture grew heavily , especially after the holding of the National Agriculture Fair in February, 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fair highlighted Liberian agricultural productivity, and while outlining the challenges faced by producers and agribusinesses, it also presented the abundant opportunities in agriculture and agribusiness. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I can proudly report to you that the number of commercial farms and agribusinesses more than significantly increased from 77 in 2021 to 164 in 2022, while there are now dealerships of agricultural machinery, complete with spare parts and workshops. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a positive development for the efforts to mechanize Liberian farm production, and is a natural next step to the Government of Liberia’s own efforts through the Ministry of Agriculture, to provide tools, equipment, seeds, seedlings to farmers, farming communities and cooperatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interventions we made as a Government have led to increased acres planted in most crops, but especially so for basic foods like rice, cassava, oil palm and vegetables.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the country moved into harvest season towards the end of the year, bumper crops are reaching rural and urban markets, due to improvements in the logistics and supportive infrastructure that we have provided for agriculture.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Dedicated warehouses for cocoa producers were constructed and/or rehabilitated in Nimba, Lofa and Bong counties; while processing plants for palm oil were built in Grand Bassa, Bong and Lofa counties. Rice processing plants in Lofa county were finalized in time to process the massive harvests coming in from expanded farms. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Ministry of Agriculture developed and negotiated and signed, along with the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning,  key new projects valued at over $73 million US dollars.  The World Bank’s Rural Economy Transformation Project, (RETRAP), which is meant to expand the ongoing Smallholder Transformation and Agribusiness Revitalization Project, STAR-P, was developed for a total value of $55 million US dollars. \n",
      "\n",
      "The RETRAP will oversee the paving of the road from Tappita in Nimba County to Toe Town in Grand Gedeh County, completing a vital portion of the Ganta-Harper Highway that is already ongoing. \n",
      "\n",
      "This major piece of road construction will, by next year, see the paving of the road going into neighboring Côte d’Ivoire, and will facilitate the free movement of goods, passengers and services in the sub-region. In addition, the RETRAP will drive resources into the rubber, cassava, poultry and piggery sectors to complement other projects in rice, oil palm and vegetables. \n",

      "A key part of the transformation of Liberian agriculture involves the engagement with the Private Sector. In 2021, the Nimba Rubber Corporation began exporting processed rubber from Liberia, including processing rubber from private farms for export markets. This represents a fundamental shift towards industrializing Liberia’s oldest commercial agricultural sector.\n",
      "Also in 2021, the Atlantic Cocoa Corporation exported the first containers of certified organic cocoa from Liberia. While Liberia’s cocoa production lags behind production giants in the region, Liberian cocoa continues to win awards and prizes in international competitions for its exceptional quality. My administration is therefore promoting and working to provide the enabling environment for high quality production of cash and food crops. \n",

      "Corporation with its Kernel Fresh products made from Liberian palm kernels stands out as an example of Liberian entrepreneurship excellence.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A $47 million US dollar grant received from the World Bank with a wide scope of interventions including new construction, rehabilitation, equipping training, and text books development has greatly contributed to the huge push we are making to fix the mess in the educational system.\n",

      "Renovation and rehabilitation of all 156 Public Senior Secondary Schools throughout the Country are ongoing simultaneously. As of June 2022, it is expected that all renovations works would have been completed and dedication shall be planned in phases, preferably by county.\n",

      "Under the IRISE Project and in partnership with the World Bank, we will begin the construction of three Model High School complexes in the first quarter of this year now that design and procurement requirements have been completed.  Each of the three institutions has been designed to accommodate 1,500 Senior High School students.

To reduce that gap, the IRISE Project shall fund the construction of 25 new Secondary Schools strategically situated in 25 school districts that are currently without secondary schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under this project, we are also funding the training of 35 University instructors out of the country, procuring a digital library, revising textbooks for students and upgrading curriculum. Additionally, in an effort to address the gaps in girl education, we will provide scholarship financial support for 3,000 Girls transitioning from 9th grade in 4 counties considered as having the highest rates of Girls dropout from High School. As there are no tuitions in Public Schools, sponsorship shall cover all registration fees, uniforms, text books, and annual cash allowances.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Liberia to develop, we must develop the minds of our youths. We must train our teachers so that they themselves will be able to train the minds of our youths. During the period under review, curriculum training was provided to 1,250 teachers and caregivers who have since returned to their places of assignment in Sinoe, Maryland, Grand Kru, Rivercess, River Gee & Bomi. \n",

      "Traditional and religious leaders are also beefing up the efforts to change the story and narratives of survivors and victims, as well as supporting prevention efforts of sexual and gender-based violence. While we all may be aware that \"prevention is better than cure\", we will continue to work with our UN counterparts, \n",

      "On the other hand, we are also concerned about our response to sexual and gender-based violence, which prompted the setting up of the Presidential Taskforce on Sexual and Gender Based Violence through the implementation of the \"Government of Liberia and Partner's Anti-Sexual and Gender Based Violence Roadmap 2020-2022\".\n",

      "During the period under review, the government and its partners implemented several programs intended to improve the lives of the country's youths. This is a sector that is central to every program meant to empower ordinary people. The young people of Liberia have already gone through quite a lot. While many have advanced to the next stage of their lives, others need our push.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amongst the many programs we have initiated to improve living condition for young people is the Youth Entrepreneurship and Empowerment Program (YEEP), a $2.4 million US dollar initiative funded by the African Development Bank, to get graduating students work-ready. We also are implementing the \n",
      "Entrepreneurship Development program; the Liberian Employment and Entrepreneurship Program (LEEP) and the recently launched Recovery of Economic Activities for Liberia Informal Sector Employment (REALISE), which will provide short-term employment opportunities to a much wider demographic, including young people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government also wholly sponsors a National Youth Literacy program and a National Cadet Program. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Monrovia Vocational Training Center (MVTC) continues to provide vocational and technical skills to youths of diverse backgrounds. The Center offers a variety of training courses, including Heavy Duty and Auto Mechanic; Welding & Fabrication; Auto Electricity and Electricity; Electronics; Refrigeration & Air Condition; Masonry, Plumbing, Architectural Drafting, Carpentry; and Graphic Arts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The European Union (EU) has approved additional 26 million Euros to cover the cost of establishing state-of-the-art TVET schools in the rest of the 8 Counties that do not have them.  This is in fulfilment of our vision to have TVET Institutions in all 15 Counties.\n",
      "\n",
      "These initiatives are targeted at all Liberian youth, regardless of which county they may reside in. Thousands have already benefitted.   Over the ensuing period, the government will dedicate more resources in order to tackle the growing menace of disadvantaged Youth, otherwise referred to as Zogos.\n",
      "\n",

      "It would be remiss of me if I did not also take this opportunity to personally congratulate the Volleyball and Basketball teams from Grand Kru County for their historical victories in these categories in the 2022 National County Meet.

For the first time in many decades, on January 22, 2018, our democracy witnessed a smooth transfer of power from one elected government to another; and from one ruling political party to another political party in opposition.  We also witnessed the inauguration of Liberia’s first ever female Vice-President, Her Excellency Dr. Jewel Howard-Taylor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, another historic first was the venue itself, the Samuel K. Doe Sports Stadium, where a Liberian inauguration ceremony was held outdoors and in the open air for the very first time in our history, and for the SKD Stadium itself, it hosted the largest ever audience since its construction.  The mood was electric and  ecstatic, peaceful and harmonious.\n",

      "Our first task was to formalize my promises into a national development plan that would guide and lead us to fulfill them. We developed that plan, now known as the Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development (PAPD).  And four years ago, we began a journey to raise our country to a new level of prosperity and development.\n",

      "\n",
      "MY FELLOW CITIZENS:\n",
      "It has not been all smooth sailing, and indeed, we never expected it to be.  We were challenged to seek high office because of the serious and seemingly entrenched nature of the governance and socio-economic problems of this country that were very obvious to everyone.  And we were further challenged by the opportunity that you have given us to address and eventually solve them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Surely, we faced some major challenges in the last four years, but as a Government and as a People, we have emerged stronger. The challenges may have tried to derail and distract us,  but they did not prevent us from continuing the work of national development. \n",
      "\n",
      "Today, four years on, we continue to protect the peace and security of our people, to build more roads, transform electricity, build new hospitals and improve the quality of care, transform the challenging situation in education, build more markets for our market women around the country, and work toward improving governance and accountability for public resources. \n",
      "\n",
      "While the challenges are many, our recent macroeconomic crisis and the current COVID-19 crisis have taught us that when we are united, we can solve any problem. I am of the firm conviction that no development challenge is too big to solve when a people combine their energies, talents and resources in solving them. \n",
      "\n",
      "We came together as a people to end a deadly civil war and to overcome its effects. We came together to solve Ebola. We came together to stabilize our recent macroeconomic problems and we are together fighting COVID-19. We can do and achieve anything once we set our minds to it. That is who we are as Liberians. \n",
      "\n",
      "So let us NOT let politics divide us to the extent of destroying our country. In this Bicentennial Year, let us invoke the spirit of national unity when commemorating the first 200 years of our nation’s founding – no matter how  painful and difficult those first 200 years may have been.  Our past may be bittersweet, but with unity and oneness of purpose our present and our future can be sweeter. \n",

      "BRIEFING FOR HIS EXCELLENCY DR. GEORGE MANNEH WEAH, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA, ON THE OCCASION OF HIS VISIT TO THE STATE OF ISRAEL\n",
      "FEBRUARY 28 - APRIL 2, 2019\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "LIBERIA-ISRAEL RELATIONS\n",
      "Liberia and Israel have had long standing historical ties which was amplified in 1948 when Liberia's cast that decisive vote at the United Nations (UN) that granted Israel a modern statehood. \n",
      "\n",
      "In April 1959, the two countries signed a Treaty of Friendship, establishing formal diplomatic relations, thus making Liberia the first country in Africa to establish diplomatic ties with the State of Israel, thereby laying the basis for bilateral cooperation. However, relations between both countries were severed in 1973 in solidarity with Decision of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), emanating from the 1973 Middle East War and over Israeli’s occupation of the Sinai Peninsula.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the spirit of the April 1959 Protocol on Treaty of Friendship, the two countries have partnered in several fields, especially diplomacy, agriculture, health, culture, education, security, youth and sports, and infrastructural development. Many Liberian technicians and students are recipients of Israeli's training opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to broaden relations between the two countries, Liberia and Israel signed, a Technical Cooperation Agreement and a Trade Agreement were concluded on June 25, 1962 in Jerusalem.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1962, Israeli President Izak Ben-Zvi visited Liberia at the invitation of President William V. S. Tubman in response to an early visit that President Tubman paid in June that same year. At the end of President Tubman's visit to that country, a Joint Communiqué was issued expressing satisfaction at the level of development in Liberia–Israel ties.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1972, the Liberian Government set up, with technical assistance from Israel, the Agricultural Mechanization Company (AGRIMECO) to increase agriculture production and rural development. The company collapsed when Liberia broke off relations with Israel in 1973 in solidarity with Egypt. On 13 August 1983, the two countries resumed normal diplomatic relations, and made a joint decision to reopen Embassies in their respective capitals. \n",
      "\n",
      "Liberia–Israel bilateral cooperation was scaled down as the result of the civil conflict in Liberia which started in 1989. Part of the cooperation scale-down was attributed to the closure of the Embassy of Liberia in Tel-Aviv at the request of the Israeli Government because of the financial inability of the Liberian Government to sustain the Mission. Nonetheless, the Israeli Government supported Liberia during the course of the war and made several donations of humanitarian items including assorted medical supplies and scholarships.\n",
      "In 2013, the State of Israel awarded the Government of Liberia fifteen (15) short term training opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilateral Cooperation between Liberia and Israel culminated into the signing of several Agreements as follow::\n",
      "Technical Cooperation Agreement signed on 25 June 1962 in Jerusalem, Israel.\n",
      "Trade Agreement signed on 25 June 1962 in Jerusalem, Israel.\n",
      "Agreement on the Establishment and Operation of Air Services signed on 26 September 1972 in Jerusalem, Israel.\n",
      "In 1983, the two countries concluded a Memorandum of Understanding for cooperation in various fields including infrastructure development and aviation.  An Israeli private company Jonah International obtained contract for the construction of a new National Defense Building in return for a forest concession.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CONTRIBUTION TO EBOLA\n",
      "The State of Israel donated 1 unit mobile clinic received by the Ebola Command Center of Liberia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "TALKING POINTS:\n",
      "\n",
      "After the normal exchange of pleasantries, Your Excellency may wish to elaborate on the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "Extol the long standing relationship subsisting between Liberia and Israel. It would be worthy to emphasize the historic role of Liberia in the global affirmation of the statehood of the State of Israel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recall the historic exchanges of numerous visits at the highest levels between the two countries which resulted into the signing of several communiqué demonstrated by the ongoing cordial ties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mention Israel's support to peace and stability in Liberia, as well as support given through the United Nations (UN) and other international bodies.\n",
      "Express appreciation to the Government of Israel for the efforts to strengthen bilateral cooperation with Liberia evidenced by the accreditation of an Ambassador near our capital. You can assure that modalities are in the works to designate a reciprocal representation in Israel as well. \n",
      "You can acknowledge the enthusiasm and hard work of the Israeli Ambassador accredited to Liberia for igniting the momentum in our relations in a short period since receiving his Letter of Credentials.\n",
      "Express Liberia’s desire to reactivate bilateral agreements signed between our two countries, and to explore new areas interest for enhancing cooperation.\n",
      "Emphasize on development in agriculture, infrastructure, roads, security (intelligence), ports, energy and telecommunications. Liberia now needs the kind of investment that will create jobs and expand the economy on a sustainable basis. \n",
      "There is much to be learnt from Israel; extend an invitation to Israelis investment and investors, particularly, in the agriculture sector, to participate in the country's development drive. Your Excellency may recall the positive impact of AGRIMECO in boosting the economy and rural development, as well as the creation of jobs in Liberia during 1960s-1980s.\n",
      "You can seek partnership with the Israelis for the expansion of CARI and the rehabilitation and operation of Clay Youth Agriculture Training Center. Cooperation with these entities will leverage the arable land advantage of Liberia in the sub-region.\n",
      "During a meeting with the Israeli Ambassador in early May, 2016, emphasis was placed on the need for Israeli private sector intervention in the energy sector taking into consideration the overall energy deficit even after the completion of the Mount Coffee Hydro Plant.  \n",
      "Emphasize that your Government’s agenda for doing business is anchored on value addition especially in agriculture, fisheries, and oil palm, coffee, cocoa, and mining sectors, which can create more jobs to address youth unemployment.\n",
      "Mention the progress made by the Liberian Government in maintaining 15 years of peace in Liberia.\n",
      " Reaffirm Liberia's support for regional and International peace and security, democracy and good governance, and respect for human rights, as was demonstrated during the historic transition in January 2018. \n",
      "Encourage the Government of Israel to support Liberia’s Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) sector where Israel has been immensely contributing in other West African countries. \n",
      "\n",
      "Reiterate that Liberia is concerned about regional security; especially, in the face of increased terrorist attack in the sub-region occasioned by the end of mission of UNMIL in Liberia;\n",
      "You may want to aver that security cooperation with Israel will be critical to buttress our security readiness following the ongoing UNMIL transition.  Advanced training could be provided for our Emergency Response Unit of the Liberia National Police as well as the Executive Protection Service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Israel has a strong Diaspora engagement program that is immensely contributing to the growth of Israeli economy. You may want to inform about Liberia’s Diaspora engagement initiative and seek cooperation in this regard. We will like to model our program behind Israel’s wherein they can share experience with Liberia in developing our Diaspora program.\n",
      "Your Excellency may seek for support to Liberia Human Resource Development by the provision of scholarships and other short term training for Liberia's health and agriculture personnel. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, you can wish the President/Prime Minister good health and best wishes, and for the people of Israel, political and economic cohesion and prosperity.\n",

      "Briefing Notes for President Weah for Meeting with the heads of USAID and Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC)\n",
      "USAID\n",
      "Mr. Mark Greene, USAID administrator, will try to describe USAID’s mission in Liberia. He will talk about a new initiative he is developing, which is called Journey to Self-Reliance, which was announced on August 10, 2018. This program is a new way USAID wants to engage developing countries. It is similar to the MCC model where countries have to pass some indicators to qualify for MCC money. With the USAID new program, countries will not have to pass the USAID indicators but these indicators will be used to help countries improve governance in countries. \n",
      "Mr. Greene will also describe USAID current work in Liberia. \n",
      "\n",
      "President Weah’s Response:\n",
      "The President can begin by thanking Mr. Greene for the meeting and for his new vision. He can joke of course every new leader in a country or an organization should come up with a new vision for change. So he is not surprised that Mr. Greene has developed this new approach. The President can also joke that the war between USAID and MCC now appears to be over since the USAID is now moving to a model that is similar to MCC. (Background of this joke and just for the President’s knowledge: MCC was established under President Bush, a Republican and USAID is associated with the Democrats. They always have some competition for US Congress money) \n",
      "The President should thank Mr. Greene for USAID’s support to Liberia. USAID has been an important partner in Liberia’s development. \n",
      "Say that his new vision, the Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development will be launched before November 2018 and thank USAID for making contribution to the plan. \n",
      "Show appreciation that USAID wants to support his Pro-Poor Agenda by supporting a Special Economic Zone in Buchanan, Grand Bassa County.   Say SEZ’s are critical for job creation in the shortest possible time and he will give priority to this project. \n",
      "Welcome Mr. Greene’s new initiative and say that this will actually be helpful for his new government. \n",
      "\n",
      "MCC\n",
      "Mr. Brock Bierman, Acting Chief Executive Officer of MCC, will aim to update the President on MCC support to Liberia: Support for the Mount Coffee Hydro Dam; for the Management Contract at the Liberian Electricity Corporation; and for the 15 million Matching Fund to support the Road Fund. Mr. Bierman may also discuss some of the challenges of the Compact. Mr. Bierman may thank the President for solving some of the recent challenges by making appointments to the LEC Board,   the Liberia Energy Regulatory Commission (LERC) and by resolving the challenges of the Road Fund. \n",
      "\n",
      "He may raise the issue of Joseph Howe “running a parallel management with ESBI”. (This morning the Commercial Manager from ESBI met me on this issue. He said he was sent to discuss how we can resolve the challenge since it is posing problems for them.) MCC is also saying that this will affect the Compact if it is not resolved. I assured them that the President remains committed to resolving these issues and we will work to ensure Mr. Howe works in line with the LEC contract. I also set up an LEC briefing for with the president upon his return.   \n",
      "\n",
      "President’s Response\n",
      "The President can thank Brock him for MCC support to Liberia and note that he and the Liberian people remain grateful for the MCC Compact. As he always does, he can inform the CEO that he helped mobilize support for the Compact while he was a Senator. \n",
      "The President should express commitment to the MCC compact to ensure that it comes to a successful conclusion. \n",
      "He should say he is committed to supporting the Management Services Contract entered ESBI Contract with the Liberia Electricity Corporation but would like to see the contractors move fast on training Liberians who will replace them once their contract expires. \n",
      "He should allay their fears if the Howe issue comes up. \n",
      "He should express some disappointment that the Mount Coffee Hydro plant has been refurbished but the there are no transmission and distribution networks to take electricity to the people. He can thank the World Bank, EU and other partners who are doing transmission and distribution projects, but say he is looking for more transmission projects to take electricity to more people. \n",
      "He should say that the Road Fund challenge has now been resolved and the road fund is now in operation. He is committed to using the road fund for road maintenance and for developing roads in the country. \n",
      "He should say that he believes MCC is in the process of making goods its contribution to the road fund.\n",

      "\n",
      "Sierra Leone’s remarkable journey as a free and independent country bears great resemblance with Liberia. Envisaged as a haven for freed slaves and freed men of color from the so-called New World, both countries were thrust into an experiment of western-domination and governance, alien to the cultural practices of the indigenes. \n",

      "I am also here today to celebrate the transformative leadership my brother and friend President Bio has brought to this great country which is experiencing an unprecedented level of national development and progress. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sixty years of existence as an independent country is no easy feat. \n",
      "It took blood and sweat, sacrifices, sound leadership, compromises, fervent prayers; but above all, the resilience of the great people of Sierra Leone who endured so much, and are uncompromising in their collective resolve to build a nation anchored on peace, stability, freedom and democracy, human rights and the rule of law. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, it is pleasing to note that Liberia will continue to deepen its collaboration and partnership with Sierra Leone in the areas of peace building and security; as well as in the fight against illicit drugs and child trafficking.  My government assures you of its continuous cooperation in the promotion of border security, trade and commerce. As Peace, security, unity and harmony are prerequisites for the development of any nation, let us continue to rededicate ourselves to our partnership in the pursuit of these noble objectives for our Mano River Union Basin, our sub-region, our continent and the world at large. \n",
      " \n",
      "Recent developments in the global community; especially the Coronavirus (COVID 19) Pandemic have tested our leadership and made all too obvious the resounding need for multilateralism. Mutuality of vulnerability is being witnessed by both rich and poor countries alike. While the international community seems to be working in one accord to combat this COVID 19 Pandemic, I want to call on all our people; especially in the Mano River Union Basin, to be vigilant in our individual responsibility to eradicate this pandemic.\n",
      "4\n",
      "I need not expound of the economic ramifications of the COVID 19 Pandemic to our both countries. To stay afloat as a nation and provide quality services and cater to the wellbeing of our respective populations amidst the debilitating and cascading effects of COVID 19, requires an uncommon leadership. This, my brother and friend, President Bio has demonstrated and continues to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, Liberia and Sierra Leone have been on this path before with the advent of the EBOLA Virus disease. Even though we garnered some experiences in fighting back through our response mechanisms, nothing ever prepared us for the COVID 19 Pandemic. At least, we are fighting back albeit with challenges. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I wish you my brother and friend Your Excellency President Julius Maada Bio continued good health and personal well-being as you lead your Government and steer the ship of state of the Republic of Sierra Leone to nobler heights; and the Great People of Sierra Leone my endless love as we all continue to relentlessly endeavor to a brighter and prosperous future. And it is also my ardent hope that relations between our two countries and great peoples will be further deepened for the betterment of our two countries and peoples. LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC OF SIEERA LEONE; LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA; LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC OF COTE d’IVOIRE, LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA, LONG LIVE THE MANO RIVER UNION; LONG LIVE ECOWAS, LONG LIVE THE AFRICAN UNION AND LONG LIVE THE UNITED NATIONS. \n",

      "\n",
      "I am honored to have been given this opportunity to make a modest contribution to the discussions at this historic first Paris Peace Forum.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In this regard, I would like to share my views on the importance of peace and security to international stability and the growth and development of nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without peace, the world can never be stable.  Peace is an essential element for global advancement, and provides a positive framework for international cooperation and the enhancement of global trade and commerce.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is therefore incumbent upon all nations, if we are to establish a new world order where peace prevails, to seek to resolve conflicts through dialogue, negotiations, and mediation, rather than war.  The time for war is over.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is why we should take a new look at the international alliances that we form.  Nations join with other like-minded nations to protect their common interests, and to promote the collective welfare of their peoples.  And this is a good thing, because in unity there is strength, and the whole can become larger than the sum of its individual constituents.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, one of the fundamental assumptions of such alliances is that “the enemy of my friend is my enemy”, and therefore an external threat to one member is a threat to all members.  In my view, this is not always necessarily the case, and therefore it is important to review each situation in context, to determine whether there is indeed a common threat that requires a common response.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many times, the unintended consequence of group action against a perceived threat to one of its members, is that some of the other nations in the alliance may become highly vulnerable to terrorism and other acts of indirect retaliation, for which they may not have the resources or expertise to protect themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is therefore important that the international community should give serious consideration to changing the paradigm for resolving differences and threats, by moving away from military action as a primary option, to conflict resolution by non-violent means.  \n",
      "\n",
      "While military force can be used to counter a military threat, it cannot, on its own, resolve profound underlying political, social, economic and governance problems or create sustainable peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is only through peace-building efforts, including diplomacy, dialogue, negotiation, mediation, and participation, that we will be able to meet Sustainable Development Goal #16: to “promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It is through our success as global and national peace-builders that we will be able to achieve social and economic justice, reconciliation among and between our respective countries and peoples, enhance our individual and collective security, and provide the conducive environment for sustainable development.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must therefore concentrate on -- and invest in – peace-building and conflict prevention as an urgent and central priority, if we are to create a safer and more prosperous world.\n",
      "On this note, I am delighted to once more engage with other actors of global governance, and exchange views on the way forward for international peace and prosperity for all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thank you.\n",

      "\n",
      "However, we recognize that there have been many challenges in the past twelve (12) months; challenges with housing, welfare, logistics, compulsory savings, and other issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Commander-in-Chief, I have been personally engaged in the search for lasting solutions to these challenges.  I have visited the military base where, incidentally, I once lived with my uncle, Robert Bobowleh Wulateh Wreh, and have engaged in direct dialogues with the officers and men and women in arms, with the aim of hearing from them, in an open forum, about their concerns and needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of these and other interactions with members of the military at various levels, many of these concerns are now being addressed.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we have begun the renovation of existing military barracks to facilitate de-congestion of the current facilities.  Additionally, we will seek further support from Government to modernize and expand the barracks with paved roads and proper sports and recreational facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a lighter note, during one of these visits, the military invited the Cabinet, to play a friendly football match, thinking perhaps that they could their military tactics to the soccer pitch for an easy win.  However, they failed to reckon with the fact that the Captain of the Cabinet team was Africa’s first and only Ballon d’Or winner, and they paid for that mistake with a 3 - 0 loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have also deployed new equipment and hardware, such as armored personal carriers, to give our military personnel protected and efficient mobility.\n",

      "\n",
      "Yesterday, we completed our final inspection of the hospital,  which was most satisfactory.  And so I am pleased to inform you today that the 14 Military Hospital is nearing completion, and will soon be dedicated and fully operational, to cater to the critical health needs of our servicemen and women and their families, as well as the citizens living in nearby communities.\n",

      "However, we recognize that there have been many challenges in the past twelve (12) months; challenges with housing, welfare, logistics, compulsory savings, and other issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Commander-in-Chief, I have been personally engaged in the search for lasting solutions to these challenges.  I have visited the military base where, incidentally, I once lived with my uncle, Robert Bobowleh Wulateh Wreh, and have engaged in direct dialogues with the officers and men and women in arms, with the aim of hearing from them, in an open forum, about their concerns and needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of these and other interactions with members of the military at various levels, many of these concerns are now being addressed.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we have begun the renovation of existing military barracks to facilitate de-congestion of the current facilities.  Additionally, we will seek further support from Government to modernize and expand the barracks with paved roads and proper sports and recreational facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a lighter note, during one of these visits, the military invited the Cabinet, to play a friendly football match, thinking perhaps that they could their military tactics to the soccer pitch for an easy win.  However, they failed to reckon with the fact that the Captain of the Cabinet team was Africa’s first and only Ballon d’Or winner, and they paid for that mistake with a 3 - 0 loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have also deployed new equipment and hardware, such as armored personal carriers, to give our military personnel protected and efficient mobility.\n",

      "\n",
      "Yesterday, we completed our final inspection of the hospital,  which was most satisfactory.  And so I am pleased to inform you today that the 14 Military Hospital is nearing completion, and will soon be dedicated and fully operational, to cater to the critical health needs of our servicemen and women and their families, as well as the citizens living in nearby communities.\n",

      "I am pleased to have been invited to make the Opening Remarks by the organizers of this Stakeholders Conference on Home-Grown School Feeding.  This is because my Government not only recognizes the importance of education for our children, but is also concerned about the need to ensure food security and nutrition for the Liberian people.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I am therefore delighted that you are gathered here today to map out and deliberate on the framework of support that should actualize these concerns through a number of flagship initiatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "This Conference, under the theme “Grow at home, eat at School to Change and Save Lives” could not have happened at a better moment, as we this week celebrate the 171st Independence Anniversary of the founding of Liberia, and the first such celebration under my Administration. \n",
      "\n",
      "The conference is also timely because the concept of the Home-Grown School Feeding is fully aligned to our national development blue-print; known as the Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, Home-Grown School Feeding contributes to the eventual realization of a number of Sustainable Development Goals, such as those which call for ending poverty and hunger; improving nutrition for good health and well-being; the provision of quality education for our children, and the empowerment of girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea of feeding in school plays two essential roles in our society: it serves as a motivator and encouragement for children to attend classes; and at the same time nourishes the brain to perform at its highest levels of cognition.  It also helps to reduce the high mal-nourishment amongst school-age children, and improves their learning abilities. \n",
      "\n",
      "Feeding in our school system is not a new idea.  Before the Liberian Civil Conflict, most public schools benefited from the Care Food Program which was initiated by the Government of Liberia.  Again, in the early 1990s, the UN re-introduced the concept of feeding in schools, but that effort was short lived. \n",
      "\n",
      "The previous school feeding programs in Liberia were unsustainable because of the high financial costs associated with the importation of the basic foods used in them.   \n",
      "Now, with the introduction of this new home-grown concept, which allows local farmers to produce the bulk of the food, costs will be lower, and the local farmers will be financially better off by having a secure market for their products, as they become an integral part of the food supply chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will increase their agricultural output and thereby increase their income.  All of these new variables, working together, should ensure that a home-grown feeding program is both cost-effective and sustainable.\n",
      "\n",
      "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\n",
      "\n",
      "I would like to encourage all the stakeholders present today, and, in particular, the development partners, to provide all possible support within your means to this initiative.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The potential that the Home-Grown School Feeding has in lifting our people out of poverty, and availing to them new livelihood and developmental opportunities -- not only to our farmers -- but also enhancing better educational results to our students, cannot be over-emphasized. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I am aware that some of the partners have already expressed interest in supporting this initiative. I would like to thank you for the interest so far and encourage you and others to concretize your efforts in this regard. \n",
      "\n",
      "In closing, I want to assure you that this program has my personal support, because of the great potential that it holds for education, agriculture, and transformation of our economy. \n",
      "I would like to congratulate the parties to this initiative, and call upon all stakeholders to strongly support it.  Because, through its implementation, we have an opportunity to better the future of our children, and improve the quality of life of our local farmers. \n",
      "\n",
      "AND NOW, ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBERIA, I DECLARE THIS CONFERENCE OFFICIALLY OPEN.  I PRAY THAT YOUR DELIBERATIONS WILL BE FRUITFUL, FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THE LIBERIA PEOPLE.\n",

      "Revenue collection for 2021, including grants, was $646 million U.S. dollars, compared to $653.9 million U.S. dollars in 2020.  This apparent decrease is attributable to more international Covid-related funding that was received in Calendar Year 2020.  This revenue performance was driven by higher receipts of tax and non-tax revenues, especially taxes on international trade.\n",

      "As part of my vision to ensure sustainable fiscal and developmental decentralization of the resources of the Republic, I embarked on a nation-wide county tour in 2021. \n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of the tour was to engage the citizens of our noble country directly; to listen to them; to see, feel, and to understand their plights; while gathering valuable input from them in terms of their collective direction for our country.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Speaker, during the tour, I visited and held town hall meetings in about 70 districts in 14 of the 15 counties.  Very shortly in the coming weeks I will complete my County tour with Montserrado County.   Traveling to and sleeping in those districts, towns and villages, showed me the chronic level of underdevelopment being endured by our people that are living in rural Liberia since the founding of our great nation 200 years ago. \n",
      "\n",
      "I saw abject poverty and the lack of development across our country, which are characterized by bad roads, lack of schools and hospitals; lack of market buildings to shelter our mothers and sisters from the open elements of the rain and sun; lack of centers for the youth, women and the disabled to enrich their capacity-building efforts; the lack of housing; and the lack of financial resources to strengthen the economic capabilities of our people. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in the midst of the glaring underdevelopment across our rural counties, I also saw the hope and the golden opportunities of our beautiful country. \n",
      "\n",
      "The County Tour has therefore inspired in me a fierce urgency to meaningfully intervene to narrow the developmental gaps and increase the socio-economic opportunities for our people in these counties. \n",
      "\n",
      "After holding various town hall meetings and receiving hundreds of petitions from the citizens of our rural counties, I have committed to undertaking more than 400 impactful  projects within the counties to decentralize and broaden the development of our country. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "MR SPEAKER:\n",
      "\n",
      "In that regard, I am pleased to inform you that since I embarked on the County Tour in February 2021, we have not only started, but have actually completed a number of projects. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have provided 3,600 solar streetlights in 22 cities and districts in 12 of our counties that were in darkness. Solar farms and dams are being constructed to provide more electricity to our rural counties. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have also completed a 100- bed modern hospital in Bopolu City, Gbarpolu County, and another 100-bed hospital in Gbediah, Rivercess County.  Other clinics are being constructed around the country to modernize and enhance our healthcare delivery system.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, I authorized the disbursement of $2 million US dollars under the Liberia Agency for Community Empowerment (LACE) to kick-start about 17 projects. \n",

      "I also authorized funding to the Ministry of Public Works to begin the pavement of roads, construction of bridges and the layout of major city streets within our rural counties. \n",
      "\n",
      "To support our farmers, $16 million US dollars was allocated through our development partners to our local farmers, \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, I have proposed $2 million dollars in the 2022 national budget to provide business loans to our small women-owned businesses as a way of reducing poverty through the private sector. I will also be submitting a bill to you this year to enact this business loan scheme into law for its sustainability. \n",

Exploiting every opportunity to enhance our country’s development must be a collective effort from all Liberians, irrespective of our political, religious and social differences.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is why I have proposed more than $25 million US dollars in the 2022 national budget under the County Tour framework to address the roads, housing, schools, hospitals and all social development needs of our dear country, most especially the rural counties. This consists of $10 million US dollars to directly support County Tour Projects.

Tomorrow, January 25, 2022, at 12:00 noon, there will be a Ceremony held at the SKD Stadium where I will be presenting items to the Traditional Leaders of each of the 15 counties to enable and empower them to reach out to their People.\n",

      "In addition to her official duties and responsibilities as First Lady of the Republic of Liberia, my darling wife, Her Excellency Madam Clar Marie Weah, has shown a keen interest in charitable good works which involve infrastructure to accommodate some of the less fortunate in our society.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of her passion to help Liberians move towards prosperity in support of the Pro-poor Agenda, she established the Clar Hope Foundation in 2018.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One of its major initiatives is the City of Hope, which is a multipurpose complex that will provide quality education to 200 girls between the ages of 3 - 5, as well as serve as a refuge, a home, and a rehabilitation center for destitute Liberians, including disadvantaged youths, orphans, and street girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "The complex is comprised of modern dormitories to accommodate the students and the staff, a vocational training center, two academic school buildings with a 300-student capacity, an administrative building, a number of guest houses, a conference center, and a clinic.  The City of Hope is approximately 85 percent completed, and the opening is scheduled for early this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Clar Hope Foundation has also built an old folks home in Buchanan, Grand Bassa County.  Construction was completed in 2021, and it has been named the Decontee Home for the Elderly The 29 bed-room facility seeks to restore the desired respect and dignity seniors deserve through quality care.  Although this old folks home was built with funds raised by the Clar Hope Foundation, I have learned from a reliable source that they intend to turn the building over to the relevant Government agencies, free of charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, through the Office of the First Lady, a modern vocational training center has been built for the use of the Army Wives Association at the Edward B. Kesselly Barracks.  It comprises offices, classrooms and a conference hall.  Through this initiative, the First Lady wants to boost the capacity \n",
      "\n",
      "development of hundreds of women and girls from military families, thus enabling them to earn a decent living and support their families.  This project will be dedicated in the next few days.\n",
      "Another infrastructure development project of the Clar Hope Foundation is the Rock Hill Restoration Project, which aims to restore clean and safe drinking water to some 16,000 residents of the Rock Hill Community in Paynesville for the first time after more than 70 years. The project has been completed and will also be officially dedicated within the next few days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allow me to thank you, Clar, for your charitable good works in the interest of the Liberian people.\n",

      "MR. SPEAKER:\n",
      "\n",
      "We are making steady progress in the electricity sector, but strong challenges remain.  Since 2018 total households connected to the electricity grid has increased by more than 260 percent, from more than 49,000 customers in 2018 to about 130,000 customers by December of 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "New investments in transformers, meters and delivery of new sub-stations are all contributing to changing the electricity landscape. The Government was also able to provide more than 10,000 street lights in Monrovia and around the country, and under the current budget more street lights, including solar lights are going to be provided. \n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SPEAKER:  \n",
      "\n",
      "I am proud to report that the cost of electricity, a major challenge for businesses and households, has been reduced from 35 cents per kilowatt hour to around 24 cents per kilowatt hour for    residential customers and to 22 cents per kilowatt hour for businesses. While at 22 cents, this tariff is still higher in the West African sub-region, it is a massive development for the electricity sector in Liberia.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SPEAKER:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Millennium Challenge Compact signed between the Government of Liberia and the Government of the United States of America came to an end on January 21, 2021 after 5 years of implementation. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Compact provided a grant of $257 million U.S. dollars for the electricity and road sectors. The Compact also contributed $147 million US dollars to the rehabilitation of Mt. Coffee Hydro Power Plant and the increase of connections from 34,000 customers to over 82,000. The Liberia Electricity Regulatory Commission was also established under the Compact which is now empowered to license private operators in the electricity sector. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, an $18 million U.S. dollars raw water pipeline was constructed which has led to savings of $780,000 U. S. dollars  annually on pumping costs. These are only but a few of the projects covered under the Compact. \n",
      "\n",
      "I take this opportunity to gratefully appreciate this kind gift of the American People to the People of Liberia. My Government has embarked on concerted efforts to re-qualify for another compact through vigilant reforms that will lead to achievement of critical governance benchmarks. \n",

      "MADAM VICE PRESIDENT, MR. SPEAKER, MR. PRESIDENT PRO-TEMPORE, AND MEMBERS OF THE 54THLEGISLATURE: \n",
      "\n",
      "During my last address to this Honorable Legislature, I informed you that agricultural productivity would be a key priority of this Administration. The year in review saw several new beginnings and milestones for the agricultural sector. Private sector interest and investment in agriculture grew heavily , especially after the holding of the National Agriculture Fair in February, 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fair highlighted Liberian agricultural productivity, and while outlining the challenges faced by producers and agribusinesses, it also presented the abundant opportunities in agriculture and agribusiness. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I can proudly report to you that the number of commercial farms and agribusinesses more than significantly increased from 77 in 2021 to 164 in 2022, while there are now dealerships of agricultural machinery, complete with spare parts and workshops. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a positive development for the efforts to mechanize Liberian farm production, and is a natural next step to the Government of Liberia’s own efforts through the Ministry of Agriculture, to provide tools, equipment, seeds, seedlings to farmers, farming communities and cooperatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interventions we made as a Government have led to increased acres planted in most crops, but especially so for basic foods like rice, cassava, oil palm and vegetables.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the country moved into harvest season towards the end of the year, bumper crops are reaching rural and urban markets, due to improvements in the logistics and supportive infrastructure that we have provided for agriculture.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Dedicated warehouses for cocoa producers were constructed and/or rehabilitated in Nimba, Lofa and Bong counties; while processing plants for palm oil were built in Grand Bassa, Bong and Lofa counties. Rice processing plants in Lofa county were finalized in time to process the massive harvests coming in from expanded farms. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Ministry of Agriculture developed and negotiated and signed, along with the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning,  key new projects valued at over $73 million US dollars.  The World Bank’s Rural Economy Transformation Project, (RETRAP), which is meant to expand the ongoing Smallholder Transformation and Agribusiness Revitalization Project, STAR-P, was developed for a total value of $55 million US dollars. \n",
      "\n",
      "The RETRAP will oversee the paving of the road from Tappita in Nimba County to Toe Town in Grand Gedeh County, completing a vital portion of the Ganta-Harper Highway that is already ongoing. \n",
      "\n",
      "This major piece of road construction will, by next year, see the paving of the road going into neighboring Côte d’Ivoire, and will facilitate the free movement of goods, passengers and services in the sub-region. In addition, the RETRAP will drive resources into the rubber, cassava, poultry and piggery sectors to complement other projects in rice, oil palm and vegetables. \n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SPEAKER:\n",
      "\n",
      "Access to finance for our farmers was a key focus during the period in review. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rural Community Financing Project implemented in collaboration with the Central Bank of Liberia and the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, having been impacted by COVID-19-induced lock-downs and the closure of several banks in rural areas, was successful in getting eleven (11) Rural Community Financing Institutions more operational.\n",
      "A key part of the transformation of Liberian agriculture involves the engagement with the Private Sector. In 2021, the Nimba Rubber Corporation began exporting processed rubber from Liberia, including processing rubber from private farms for export markets. This represents a fundamental shift towards industrializing Liberia’s oldest commercial agricultural sector.\n",
      "Also in 2021, the Atlantic Cocoa Corporation exported the first containers of certified organic cocoa from Liberia. While Liberia’s cocoa production lags behind production giants in the region, Liberian cocoa continues to win awards and prizes in international competitions for its exceptional quality. My administration is therefore promoting and working to provide the enabling environment for high quality production of cash and food crops. \n",
      "The Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industry in Liberia is growing exponentially, especially with the establishment and growth of light industries. In this regard, the award-winning J-Palm \n",
      "Corporation with its Kernel Fresh products made from Liberian palm kernels stands out as an example of Liberian entrepreneurship excellence.\n",
      "Several companies and agro-processors in the cassava sector, arguably Liberia’s largest agriculture sector, also stand out for their outstanding supply of gari and fufu flour to national food reserves for re-distribution during the COVID-19 emergency. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SPEAKER: \n",
      "\n",
      "We will continue to increase our efforts to ensure value addition to our agricultural products, provide for access to our farmers and enhance support to expand mechanized farming throughout the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SPEAKER:\n",
      "\n",
      "Providing quality education to our future leaders has remained a paramount priority of my Administration. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am pleased to report that we have made great strides in improving literacy and other learning outcomes in the educational sector, with milestone achievements in the areas of Access, Quality and System Transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "These achievements and interventions include the development of continuous learning platforms and smart classrooms throughout the country, and the introduction of a distant learning framework along with virtual laboratories.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am also pleased to report that we have made the largest single investment in Senior Secondary School since the 1970s to address the huge infrastructure deficit in the education sector. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A $47 million US dollar grant received from the World Bank with a wide scope of interventions including new construction, rehabilitation, equipping training, and text books development has greatly contributed to the huge push we are making to fix the mess in the educational system.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am also pleased to report on the following deliverables in Education:\n",
      "\n",
      "Renovation and rehabilitation of all 156 Public Senior Secondary Schools throughout the Country are ongoing simultaneously. As of June 2022, it is expected that all renovations works would have been completed and dedication shall be planned in phases, preferably by county.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the IRISE Project and in partnership with the World Bank, we will begin the construction of three Model High School complexes in the first quarter of this year now that design and procurement requirements have been completed.  Each of the three institutions has been designed to accommodate 1,500 Senior High School students. My government will replicate this in other school districts to provide a better learning environment for our children. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SPEAKER:\n",
      "\n",
      "Available school statistics have it that the total number of senior secondary schools in the country is 752 as of Academic 2020 / 2021, of which, the Government owns only 156.  To reduce that gap, the IRISE Project shall fund the construction of 25 new Secondary Schools strategically situated in 25 school districts that are currently without secondary schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under this project, we are also funding the training of 35 University instructors out of the country, procuring a digital library, revising textbooks for students and upgrading curriculum. Additionally, in an effort to address the gaps in girl education, we will provide scholarship financial support for 3,000 Girls transitioning from 9th grade in 4 counties considered as having the highest rates of Girls dropout from High School. As there are no tuitions in Public Schools, sponsorship shall cover all registration fees, uniforms, text books, and annual cash allowances.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Liberia to develop, we must develop the minds of our youths. We must train our teachers so that they themselves will be able to train the minds of our youths. During the period under review, curriculum training was provided to 1,250 teachers and caregivers who have since returned to their places of assignment in Sinoe, Maryland, Grand Kru, Rivercess, River Gee & Bomi. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Major strides and inroads have also been made in technical and vocational education and training. The TVET projects include a major rehabilitation and construction of training centers in six of the 15 counties of Liberia. Additionally, an initial number of 76 TVET teachers have been sent abroad for training to support TVET institutions in Liberia upon their return. \n",
      "\n",
      "A number of them will be Master Trainers with assignment at the Booker Washington Institute, which is being scaled up to a TVET Teacher Training Institution for the future. The total number of teachers for this purpose, will be 120, of which 76 have been hired and are in training, while the reminder 44 are being recruited for subsequent training.   \n",
      "\n",
      " MR. SPEAKER:\n",
      "\n",
      "The largest single spender for education is the Government. For the budget period 2020 / 2021 the government appropriated US$79.4M US dollars out of a budget of US$570.1M million US dollars, which amounts to a 14 percent share of the national budget going to education. The total appropriation which covers all education expenditures for the year, was sub-allocated such that Basic, Secondary  and Early Childhood Subdivision of education received US$41.8M or 52,64 percent of our budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the 2022 National Budget, we intend to increase spending in education so that all the interventions we are making can lead to us transforming the sector from mess to best.\n",

      "MR. SPEAKER AND MEMBERS OF THE 54TH LEGISLATURE:, \n",
      "\n",
      "My stance in ensuring the rights and protection of all cannot be overemphasized. As a HeForShe Champion, I remain committed to the dignity of upholding human rights and safeguarding our most vulnerable population -- our women, girls and children.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a Government, one of our priorities is to reduce the incidence of sexual and gender based violence by 30 percent by 2023, through the provision of appropriate support services and access to justice systems. I am pleased to report that significant progress is being made to make this a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the emergence of the COVID-19 when most women and girls were confined in their homes, there was a steep increase in the reporting of sexual and gender-based violence cases due to the heightened awareness that we conducted in communities and at the grass-root level. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, we saw a reduction in Sexual and Gender Based Violence cases in December of 2021, compared to the reports of 2020 December. We have been able to raise awareness among communities about the referral systems, the government’s anti-Sexual and Gender Based Violence Call Center and can ensure its functionality. \n",
      "\n",
      "Traditional and religious leaders are also beefing up the efforts to change the story and narratives of survivors and victims, as well as supporting prevention efforts of sexual and gender-based violence. While we all may be aware that \"prevention is better than cure\", we will continue to work with our UN counterparts, \n",
      "INGOs, NGOs, and civil society organizations to increase efforts in preventing sexual and gender-based violence. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, we are also concerned about our response to sexual and gender-based violence, which prompted the setting up of the Presidential Taskforce on Sexual and Gender Based Violence through the implementation of the \"Government of Liberia and Partner's Anti-Sexual and Gender Based Violence Roadmap 2020-2022\".\n",
      "\n",
      "My Government has been able to procure DNA machines to aid in evidence gathering of related sexual and gender-based violence cases.  This will bring relief and justice to both survivors and alleged perpetrators during the legal proceedings of Sexual and Gender Based Violence  cases at the level of the court. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have made interventions in rehabilitation of safe homes and one-stop centers, including in River Gee and Grand Cape Mount Counties, as well as other safe spaces for children. My  Government will continue to ensure that no perpetrators shall go unpunished. \n",

      "While we strive to meet our national target of ensuring that 5,000 extremely poor and food insecure households, and 13,000 individual beneficiaries, receive cash transfers by 2023, the Liberia Social Safety Nets Project is in full swing and making significant impact, special thanks to our collaboration with World Bank and USAID. \n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the economic crisis posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we expanded the beneficiary pool with support from the Foreign Commonwealth Development Office (UKAID) and the World Bank. An additional 15,000 households within Urban Montserrado County were enrolled and benefitted– making a greater impact in the lives of 18,300 beneficiaries in three counties, with 82 percent of the beneficiaries being females and 27 percent being males. \n",
      "\n",
      "Phase Two of the program has been launched to add an additional 6,500 households by the end of March 2022. To establish the basic building blocks for social protection and an equitable and objective process to the distribution of our limited resources, the Liberian Household Social Registry under the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection is well on its way with 233,000 Households profiled across five (5) counties -- Bomi, Bong, Nimba, Maryland and Montserrado. Enrolment continues across the country and I would like to encourage all households to participate. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Our government remains cognizant of main-streaming gender in the formulation of policies and programs that drive the development of Liberia. With support from our UN counterparts we have developed, for the first time, the country's Gender Equality Profile. \n",
      "\n",
      "It provides an in-depth analysis, that will enhance the understanding of the differences in the conditions, needs, participation rates, access to resources and property rights, development planning and control of assets, decision-making powers between girls, women, boys and men in their assigned gender roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SPEAKER AND MEMBERS OF THE 54TH LEGISLATURE:\n",
      "\n",
      "During the period under review, the government and its partners implemented several programs intended to improve the lives of the country's youths. This is a sector that is central to every program meant to empower ordinary people. The young people of Liberia have already gone through quite a lot. While many have advanced to the next stage of their lives, others need our push.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amongst the many programs we have initiated to improve living condition for young people is the Youth Entrepreneurship and Empowerment Program (YEEP), a $2.4 million US dollar initiative funded by the African Development Bank, to get graduating students work-ready. We also are implementing the \n",
      "Entrepreneurship Development program; the Liberian Employment and Entrepreneurship Program (LEEP) and the recently launched Recovery of Economic Activities for Liberia Informal Sector Employment (REALISE), which will provide short-term employment opportunities to a much wider demographic, including young people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government also wholly sponsors a National Youth Literacy program and a National Cadet Program. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Monrovia Vocational Training Center (MVTC) continues to provide vocational and technical skills to youths of diverse backgrounds. The Center offers a variety of training courses, including Heavy Duty and Auto Mechanic; Welding & Fabrication; Auto Electricity and Electricity; Electronics; Refrigeration & Air Condition; Masonry, Plumbing, Architectural Drafting, Carpentry; and Graphic Arts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The European Union (EU) has approved additional 26 million Euros to cover the cost of establishing state-of-the-art TVET schools in the rest of the 8 Counties that do not have them.  This is in fulfilment of our vision to have TVET Institutions in all 15 Counties.\n",
      "\n",
      "These initiatives are targeted at all Liberian youth, regardless of which county they may reside in. Thousands have already benefitted.   Over the ensuing period, the government will dedicate more resources in order to tackle the growing menace of disadvantaged Youth, otherwise referred to as Zogos.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we are focused on the youth, let me highlight an activity that keeps them physically and mentally strong: Sports.  Despite the challenges the country's sports program has faced, it has been improving years, with the County Meet being a major highlight. \n",
      "\n",
      "Once again, I would like to congratulate Nimba County for clinching this year's soccer category.  My congratulations also go to all other winners. The tournament has brought Liberians together regardless of our differences. It is my hope that the momentum can be sustained, while we ensure  the National Soccer team, the Lone Star, can build on this energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be remiss of me if I did not also take this opportunity to personally congratulate the Volleyball and Basketball teams from Grand Kru County for their historical victories in these categories in the 2022 National County Meet.  They made history in two ways: Firstly, they won the first ever Volleyball category that was included in the County Meet, and secondly, they are the first county to ever win TWO categories in the County Meet.

      "•\tTo Improve Our Economy;\n",
      "•\tTo Empower Our Youths; and \n",
      "•\tTo Sustain Our Peace.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On the day of my Inauguration, you, and I, and Liberia, made history together.   For the first time in many decades, on January 22, 2018, our democracy witnessed a smooth transfer of power from one elected government to another; and from one ruling political party to another political party in opposition.  We also witnessed the inauguration of Liberia’s first ever female Vice-President, Her Excellency Dr. Jewel Howard-Taylor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, another historic first was the venue itself, the Samuel K. Doe Sports Stadium, where a Liberian inauguration ceremony was held outdoors and in the open air for the very first time in our history, and for the SKD Stadium itself, it hosted the largest ever audience since its construction.  The mood was electric and  ecstatic, peaceful and harmonious.\n",

      "And then, Mr. Speaker, the cheering and the dancing and the celebrations came to an end, and we had to begin the work of the People and commence the serious business of governance.\n",
      "Our first task was to formalize my promises into a national development plan that would guide and lead us to fulfill them. We developed that plan, now known as the Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development (PAPD).  And four years ago, we began a journey to raise our country to a new level of prosperity and development.\n",

      "\n",
      "I am proud and pleased to inform you today, Mr. Speaker, that four years from where we started,  this Pro-Poor Agenda remains actively on course! \n",
      "\n",
      "MY FELLOW CITIZENS:\n",
      "It has not been all smooth sailing, and indeed, we never expected it to be.  We were challenged to seek high office because of the serious and seemingly entrenched nature of the governance and socio-economic problems of this country that were very obvious to everyone.  And we were further challenged by the opportunity that you have given us to address and eventually solve them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Surely, we faced some major challenges in the last four years, but as a Government and as a People, we have emerged stronger. The challenges may have tried to derail and distract us,  but they did not prevent us from continuing the work of national development. \n",
      "\n",
      "Today, four years on, we continue to protect the peace and security of our people, to build more roads, transform electricity, build new hospitals and improve the quality of care, transform the challenging situation in education, build more markets for our market women around the country, and work toward improving governance and accountability for public resources. \n",
      "\n",
      "While the challenges are many, our recent macroeconomic crisis and the current COVID-19 crisis have taught us that when we are united, we can solve any problem. I am of the firm conviction that no development challenge is too big to solve when a people combine their energies, talents and resources in solving them. \n",
      "\n",
      "We came together as a people to end a deadly civil war and to overcome its effects. We came together to solve Ebola. We came together to stabilize our recent macroeconomic problems and we are together fighting COVID-19. We can do and achieve anything once we set our minds to it. That is who we are as Liberians. \n",

      "Two hundred years ago, some of our forebears returned to our shores, after enduring four centuries of bondage in slavery, and helped to found the Republic of Liberia. \n",
      "\n",
      "As I said during my remarks at the Kick-Off program held this month on Providence Island to commemorate the day that the settlers landed here, we must redouble our efforts to promote unity amongst all Liberians worldwide, and encourage all to make meaningful contributions to the nation-building task of our country. For ...\"in union strong, success is sure. We cannot fail...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We therefore would like to commend the Honorable Supreme Court for its Opinion handed down on the Twenty-Third of December 2019, which found that certain provisions of the Alien and Nationality Law are inconsistent with the Constitution of Liberia.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, the current Alien and Nationality Law provides that a natural-born Liberian citizen automatically loses his or her citizenship, without any due process of law in a court in Liberia, upon taking up citizenship of another country or acting in some capacity for that country. This law undermines our quest for unity amongst all Liberians - everywhere! \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, as we celebrate the Bicentennial anniversary of the founding of our country, I want to call on the Honorable Members of this 54th Legislature, in particular the Liberian Senate, to consider passage of the Bill currently before you, which seeks to codify the Opinion of the Honorable Supreme Court and make it  more true that ...  \"once a Liberian - always a Liberian.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Revenue collection for 2021, including grants, was $646 million U.S. dollars, compared to $653.9 million U.S. dollars in 2020.  This apparent decrease is attributable to more international Covid-related funding that was received in Calendar Year 2020.  This revenue performance was driven by higher receipts of tax and non-tax revenues, especially taxes on international trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of this amount, domestic taxes was $577 million U.S. dollars and external resources received from our Development Partners was  $68 million U.S. dollars. The last fiscal year recorded the highest level of domestic revenue performance since the end of the civil conflict.  We are all encouraged and challenged to sustain these efforts. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, total cash expenditure for the same period under review was $668 million U.S. dollars.  Of this amount, 44 percent was spent on compensation of Government employees, 25 percent on  goods and services, 17 percent on domestic and international debt, and 5 percent on Public Sector Investment. \n",

      "MR. SPEAKER:\n",

      "For at least the last five decades, Liberia has had a fiscal year that runs from July 1 to June 30. Liberia has been the only country in the ECOWAS sub-region that has run this fiscal year, which is out of alignment with the rest of the countries in the region.  We have  been encouraged by ECOWAS for nearly two decades now since the end of the civil war to revise our fiscal calendar.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Speaker I am proud to report that the change has finally taken place, and the year 2022 will be the first fiscal year that is also a calendar year for the national budget and other instruments and processes of the Government.  \n",

      "To facilitate this transition, we had to enact a special transitional budget which you approved at $347.9 million US dollars in the year under review.   December 31, 2021 concluded this transitional budget, which was funded exclusively by domestic revenue, and the draft national budget is presently before the House of Senate for consideration, having been passed by the House of Representatives. \n",

      "The 2022 budget was passed by the House at $785.6 million U.S. dollars. This is the largest national budget in the history of Liberia,  and with the support of the National Legislature we hope to make it the most transformative.  Domestic revenue is projected at $640.5 million US dollars, or 81.5 percent, while external resources are projected at $145 million US dollars, or 18.5 percent.  \n",

      "These capital investments will cover roads, electricity, education, national security, health, water and sanitation, transport and several other sectors. \n",
      "\n",

      "It is very clear that the success of this budget depends on strong revenue measures. It depends on all citizens paying their lawful taxes and doing so in a timely manner. In this regard, the Government in 2022 will support even more vigorously the domestic resource mobilization strategy of the Liberia Revenue Authority. \n",
      "\n",
      "Government, through the LPRA, has launched a program to keep 50 percent of all real estate taxes collected back to the counties, districts and cities where the real estate taxes are collected. This is a measure to boost real estate taxes by involving local communities and their residents, as well as ensure that part of the money stays at the local level, in keeping with the Decentralization Law that was recently passed under my Administration. The program is being piloted in Margibi County. \n",

While duty-free privileges and incentives are important to spur development, I believe that, as a country, we have been too generous with these instruments and must now begin to take a more conservative approach.\n",

      "We have made significant progress in restructuring our domestic debt. All legacy debts owed the Central Bank of Liberia, including the debt owed to the former National Bank of Liberia, were bundled into a Restructured and Consolidated Loan at the start of the IMF-supported program two years ago. This Restructured Loan totaled $487.5 million U.S. dollars. The Government pays an annual interest of $13.9 million U.S. dollars to the Central Bank of Liberia on this loan and will start to pay principal in the year 2030.\n",
      "\n",
      "The total stock of domestic debt now stands at $660 million U.S.  dollars and the total stock of external debt now stands at approximately $1.03 billion U.S. dollars for a total public debt stock valued at $1.69 billion U.S. dollars as at December 31, 2021.\n",
      "  \n",
      "The total debt stock grew by 6.29 percent compared to end-December 2020 debt stock of $1.59 billion U.S. dollars and this growth was from disbursement on both external and domestic loans. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On both domestic and external debt the Government paid the amount of $83.4 million U.S. dollars  in debt service. Of this amount, $62.8 million U.S. dollars was paid for domestic debt to the Central Bank of Liberia, to commercial banks for Treasury Bonds, and to other institutions, while $20.6 million U.S. dollars was paid to multilateral and bilateral partners. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Treasury Bonds, which were issued by the previous Government in 2013, are costing the Government more than $6 million U.S. dollars in interest annually, just to roll them over to the next period.  This is a legacy debt which my Administration inherited.  However, in the interest of continuity of Government, it is an obligation that we have to pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I am pleased to inform you that, working with the IMF, we have allocated $35 million U.S. dollars to completely redeem these very expensive Treasury Bonds.  This will free up space for investment in education, healthcare and other important priority areas. \n",

      "We are almost at the point where the audit of the consolidated revenue account will be current up to any fiscal year.  In 2018 my Administration inherited an audit backlog dating back to the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 national budgets. We have worked overtime to conduct these audits and make current the audit of the consolidated revenue account. \n",
      "\n",
      "With  the completion of the Fiscal Year 2019/2020 audit, we are making good progress.

The Government is strengthening and empowering the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission to prevent fraud and acts of corruption before they occur.  You will be aware that the House has already passed the new LACC Act giving a broader mandate to the LACC to fight corruption.   It is my hope that, in the supreme interest of the Liberian People, the Senate will soon concur. \n",
      "\n",
      "The House has also passed the new anti-money-laundering legislation, which empowers the Financial Intelligence Unit to fight illicit financial flows, such as money laundering, and drug and terrorist financing.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of my vision to ensure sustainable fiscal and developmental decentralization of the resources of the Republic, I embarked on a nation-wide county tour in 2021. \n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of the tour was to engage the citizens of our noble country directly; to listen to them; to see, feel, and to understand their plights; while gathering valuable input from them in terms of their collective direction for our country.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Speaker, during the tour, I visited and held town hall meetings in about 70 districts in 14 of the 15 counties.  Very shortly in the coming weeks I will complete my County tour with Montserrado County.   Traveling to and sleeping in those districts, towns and villages, showed me the chronic level of underdevelopment being endured by our people that are living in rural Liberia since the founding of our great nation 200 years ago. \n",
      "\n",
      "I saw abject poverty and the lack of development across our country, which are characterized by bad roads, lack of schools and hospitals; lack of market buildings to shelter our mothers and sisters from the open elements of the rain and sun; lack of centers for the youth, women and the disabled to enrich their capacity-building efforts; the lack of housing; and the lack of financial resources to strengthen the economic capabilities of our people. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in the midst of the glaring underdevelopment across our rural counties, I also saw the hope and the golden opportunities of our beautiful country. \n",
      "\n",
      "The County Tour has therefore inspired in me a fierce urgency to meaningfully intervene to narrow the developmental gaps and increase the socio-economic opportunities for our people in these counties. \n",
      "\n",
      "After holding various town hall meetings and receiving hundreds of petitions from the citizens of our rural counties, I have committed to undertaking more than 400 impactful  projects within the counties to decentralize and broaden the development of our country. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "MR SPEAKER:\n",
      "\n",
      "In that regard, I am pleased to inform you that since I embarked on the County Tour in February 2021, we have not only started, but have actually completed a number of projects. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have provided 3,600 solar streetlights in 22 cities and districts in 12 of our counties that were in darkness. Solar farms and dams are being constructed to provide more electricity to our rural counties. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have also completed a 100- bed modern hospital in Bopolu City, Gbarpolu County, and another 100-bed hospital in Gbediah, Rivercess County.  Other clinics are being constructed around the country to modernize and enhance our healthcare delivery system.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, I authorized the disbursement of $2 million US dollars under the Liberia Agency for Community Empowerment (LACE) to kick-start about 17 projects. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also authorized funding to the Ministry of Public Works to begin the pavement of roads, construction of bridges and the layout of major city streets within our rural counties. \n",
      "\n",
      "To support our farmers, $16 million US dollars was allocated through our development partners to our local farmers, \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, I have proposed $2 million dollars in the 2022 national budget to provide business loans to our small women-owned businesses as a way of reducing poverty through the private sector. I will also be submitting a bill to you this year to enact this business loan scheme into law for its sustainability. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "MR. SPEAKER:\n",
      "\n",
      "Our country is stronger when we are all stronger together. No one should be left behind in terms of development. When each and every county is developed, then Liberia is developed. Exploiting every opportunity to enhance our country’s development must be a collective effort from all Liberians, irrespective of our political, religious and social differences.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is why I have proposed more than $25 million US dollars in the 2022 national budget under the County Tour framework to address the roads, housing, schools, hospitals and all social development needs of our dear country, most especially the rural counties. This consists of $10 million US dollars to directly support County Tour Projects.  The remaining $15 million US dollars is an aggregate of various line items already earmarked in the Budget for County-related development expenditure. \n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SPEAKER:\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the glaring deficiencies that I witnessed during my County Tour was the lack of mobility within the official and traditional governance structures to enable administrators to reach out to their citizens in an efficient and effective manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have decided to address this issue with urgency and with decisive action.  Tomorrow, January 25, 2022, at 12:00 noon, there will be a Ceremony held at the SKD Stadium where I will be presenting items to the Traditional Leaders of each of the 15 counties to enable and empower them to reach out to their People.\n",
      "\n",
      "These items will consist of the following: One (1) Special Utility Vehicle for the use of Chief Zanzan Kawa, the head of the Traditional Council of Chiefs; Thirty (30) Pickups – two (2) for each county; One hundred and fifty (150) motorbikes – ten (10) for each county; and Fifteen (15) ambulances – one (1) each for the health services in each county.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from the ambulances, which are provided and paid for by the Government of Liberia, all other items are donated by me in my personal capacity.  You are all invited to attend and witness this ceremony, if you can find the time.\n",

      "One of its major initiatives is the City of Hope, which is a multipurpose complex that will provide quality education to 200 girls between the ages of 3 - 5, as well as serve as a refuge, a home, and a rehabilitation center for destitute Liberians, including disadvantaged youths, orphans, and street girls.\n",

      "The complex is comprised of modern dormitories to accommodate the students and the staff, a vocational training center, two academic school buildings with a 300-student capacity, an administrative building, a number of guest houses, a conference center, and a clinic.  The City of Hope is approximately 85 percent completed, and the opening is scheduled for early this year.\n",

Construction was completed in 2021, and it has been named the Decontee Home for the Elderly The 29 bed-room facility seeks to restore the desired respect and dignity seniors deserve through quality care.  Although this old folks home was built with funds raised by the Clar Hope Foundation, I have learned from a reliable source that they intend to turn the building over to the relevant Government agencies, free of charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, through the Office of the First Lady, a modern vocational training center has been built for the use of the Army Wives Association at the Edward B. Kesselly Barracks.

      "New investments in transformers, meters and delivery of new sub-stations are all contributing to changing the electricity landscape.

      "During my last address to this Honorable Legislature, I informed you that agricultural productivity would be a key priority of this Administration. The year in review saw several new beginnings and milestones for the agricultural sector. Private sector interest and investment in agriculture grew heavily , especially after the holding of the National Agriculture Fair in February, 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fair highlighted Liberian agricultural productivity, and while outlining the challenges faced by producers and agribusinesses, it also presented the abundant opportunities in agriculture and agribusiness. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I can proudly report to you that the number of commercial farms and agribusinesses more than significantly increased from 77 in 2021 to 164 in 2022, while there are now dealerships of agricultural machinery, complete with spare parts and workshops. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a positive development for the efforts to mechanize Liberian farm production, and is a natural next step to the Government of Liberia’s own efforts through the Ministry of Agriculture, to provide tools, equipment, seeds, seedlings to farmers, farming communities and cooperatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interventions we made as a Government have led to increased acres planted in most crops, but especially so for basic foods like rice, cassava, oil palm and vegetables.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the country moved into harvest season towards the end of the year, bumper crops are reaching rural and urban markets, due to improvements in the logistics and supportive infrastructure that we have provided for agriculture.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Dedicated warehouses for cocoa producers were constructed and/or rehabilitated in Nimba, Lofa and Bong counties; while processing plants for palm oil were built in Grand Bassa, Bong and Lofa counties. Rice processing plants in Lofa county were finalized in time to process the massive harvests coming in from expanded farms. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Ministry of Agriculture developed and negotiated and signed, along with the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning,  key new projects valued at over $73 million US dollars.  The World Bank’s Rural Economy Transformation Project, (RETRAP), which is meant to expand the ongoing Smallholder Transformation and Agribusiness Revitalization Project, STAR-P, was developed for a total value of $55 million US dollars. \n",
      "\n",
      "The RETRAP will oversee the paving of the road from Tappita in Nimba County to Toe Town in Grand Gedeh County, completing a vital portion of the Ganta-Harper Highway that is already ongoing. \n",
      "\n",
      "This major piece of road construction will, by next year, see the paving of the road going into neighboring Côte d’Ivoire, and will facilitate the free movement of goods, passengers and services in the sub-region. In addition, the RETRAP will drive resources into the rubber, cassava, poultry and piggery sectors to complement other projects in rice, oil palm and vegetables. \n",

      "A key part of the transformation of Liberian agriculture involves the engagement with the Private Sector. In 2021, the Nimba Rubber Corporation began exporting processed rubber from Liberia, including processing rubber from private farms for export markets. This represents a fundamental shift towards industrializing Liberia’s oldest commercial agricultural sector.\n",
      "Also in 2021, the Atlantic Cocoa Corporation exported the first containers of certified organic cocoa from Liberia. While Liberia’s cocoa production lags behind production giants in the region, Liberian cocoa continues to win awards and prizes in international competitions for its exceptional quality. My administration is therefore promoting and working to provide the enabling environment for high quality production of cash and food crops. \n",
      "The Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industry in Liberia is growing exponentially, especially with the establishment and growth of light industries. In this regard, the award-winning J-Palm \n",
      "Corporation with its Kernel Fresh products made from Liberian palm kernels stands out as an example of Liberian entrepreneurship excellence.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A $47 million US dollar grant received from the World Bank with a wide scope of interventions including new construction, rehabilitation, equipping training, and text books development has greatly contributed to the huge push we are making to fix the mess in the educational system.\n",

      "Renovation and rehabilitation of all 156 Public Senior Secondary Schools throughout the Country are ongoing simultaneously. As of June 2022, it is expected that all renovations works would have been completed and dedication shall be planned in phases, preferably by county.\n",

      "Under the IRISE Project and in partnership with the World Bank, we will begin the construction of three Model High School complexes in the first quarter of this year now that design and procurement requirements have been completed.

To reduce that gap, the IRISE Project shall fund the construction of 25 new Secondary Schools strategically situated in 25 school districts that are currently without secondary schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under this project, we are also funding the training of 35 University instructors out of the country, procuring a digital library, revising textbooks for students and upgrading curriculum. Additionally, in an effort to address the gaps in girl education, we will provide scholarship financial support for 3,000 Girls transitioning from 9th grade in 4 counties considered as having the highest rates of Girls dropout from High School. As there are no tuitions in Public Schools, sponsorship shall cover all registration fees, uniforms, text books, and annual cash allowances.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Liberia to develop, we must develop the minds of our youths. We must train our teachers so that they themselves will be able to train the minds of our youths. During the period under review, curriculum training was provided to 1,250 teachers and caregivers who have since returned to their places of assignment in Sinoe, Maryland, Grand Kru, Rivercess, River Gee & Bomi. \n",

For the budget period 2020 / 2021 the government appropriated US$79.4M US dollars out of a budget of US$570.1M million US dollars, which amounts to a 14 percent share of the national budget going to education. The total appropriation which covers all education expenditures for the year, was sub-allocated such that Basic, Secondary  and Early Childhood Subdivision of education received US$41.8M or 52,64 percent of our budget.\n",

I am pleased to report that significant progress is being made to make this a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the emergence of the COVID-19 when most women and girls were confined in their homes, there was a steep increase in the reporting of sexual and gender-based violence cases due to the heightened awareness that we conducted in communities and at the grass-root level. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, we saw a reduction in Sexual and Gender Based Violence cases in December of 2021, compared to the reports of 2020 December. We have been able to raise awareness among communities about the referral systems, the government’s anti-Sexual and Gender Based Violence Call Center and can ensure its functionality. \n",

      "Traditional and religious leaders are also beefing up the efforts to change the story and narratives of survivors and victims, as well as supporting prevention efforts of sexual and gender-based violence. While we all may be aware that \"prevention is better than cure\", we will continue to work with our UN counterparts, \n",

      "On the other hand, we are also concerned about our response to sexual and gender-based violence, which prompted the setting up of the Presidential Taskforce on Sexual and Gender Based Violence through the implementation of the \"Government of Liberia and Partner's Anti-Sexual and Gender Based Violence Roadmap 2020-2022\".\n",
      "\n",
      "My Government has been able to procure DNA machines to aid in evidence gathering of related sexual and gender-based violence cases.  This will bring relief and justice to both survivors and alleged perpetrators during the legal proceedings of Sexual and Gender Based Violence  cases at the level of the court. \n",

We also witnessed the inauguration of Liberia’s first ever female Vice-President, Her Excellency Dr. Jewel Howard-Taylor.\n",

      "Our first task was to formalize my promises into a national development plan that would guide and lead us to fulfill them. We developed that plan, now known as the Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development (PAPD).  And four years ago, we began a journey to raise our country to a new level of prosperity and development.\n",

      "MY FELLOW CITIZENS:\n",
      "It has not been all smooth sailing, and indeed, we never expected it to be.  We were challenged to seek high office because of the serious and seemingly entrenched nature of the governance and socio-economic problems of this country that were very obvious to everyone.  And we were further challenged by the opportunity that you have given us to address and eventually solve them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Surely, we faced some major challenges in the last four years, but as a Government and as a People, we have emerged stronger. The challenges may have tried to derail and distract us,  but they did not prevent us from continuing the work of national development. \n",
      "\n",
      "Today, four years on, we continue to protect the peace and security of our people, to build more roads, transform electricity, build new hospitals and improve the quality of care, transform the challenging situation in education, build more markets for our market women around the country, and work toward improving governance and accountability for public resources. \n",
      "\n",
      "While the challenges are many, our recent macroeconomic crisis and the current COVID-19 crisis have taught us that when we are united, we can solve any problem. I am of the firm conviction that no development challenge is too big to solve when a people combine their energies, talents and resources in solving them. \n",
      "\n",
      "We came together as a people to end a deadly civil war and to overcome its effects. We came together to solve Ebola.

That is who we are as Liberians. \n",

In this Bicentennial Year, let us invoke the spirit of national unity when commemorating the first 200 years of our nation’s founding – no matter how  painful and difficult those first 200 years may have been.

      "\n",
      "LIBERIA-ISRAEL RELATIONS\n",
      "Liberia and Israel have had long standing historical ties which was amplified in 1948 when Liberia's cast that decisive vote at the United Nations (UN) that granted Israel a modern statehood. \n",
      "\n",
      "In April 1959, the two countries signed a Treaty of Friendship, establishing formal diplomatic relations, thus making Liberia the first country in Africa to establish diplomatic ties with the State of Israel, thereby laying the basis for bilateral cooperation. However, relations between both countries were severed in 1973 in solidarity with Decision of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), emanating from the 1973 Middle East War and over Israeli’s occupation of the Sinai Peninsula.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the spirit of the April 1959 Protocol on Treaty of Friendship, the two countries have partnered in several fields, especially diplomacy, agriculture, health, culture, education, security, youth and sports, and infrastructural development. Many Liberian technicians and students are recipients of Israeli's training opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to broaden relations between the two countries, Liberia and Israel signed, a Technical Cooperation Agreement and a Trade Agreement were concluded on June 25, 1962 in Jerusalem.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1962, Israeli President Izak Ben-Zvi visited Liberia at the invitation of President William V. S. Tubman in response to an early visit that President Tubman paid in June that same year. At the end of President Tubman's visit to that country, a Joint Communiqué was issued expressing satisfaction at the level of development in Liberia–Israel ties.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1972, the Liberian Government set up, with technical assistance from Israel, the Agricultural Mechanization Company (AGRIMECO) to increase agriculture production and rural development. The company collapsed when Liberia broke off relations with Israel in 1973 in solidarity with Egypt. On 13 August 1983, the two countries resumed normal diplomatic relations, and made a joint decision to reopen Embassies in their respective capitals. \n",
      "\n",
      "Liberia–Israel bilateral cooperation was scaled down as the result of the civil conflict in Liberia which started in 1989. Part of the cooperation scale-down was attributed to the closure of the Embassy of Liberia in Tel-Aviv at the request of the Israeli Government because of the financial inability of the Liberian Government to sustain the Mission. Nonetheless, the Israeli Government supported Liberia during the course of the war and made several donations of humanitarian items including assorted medical supplies and scholarships.\n",
      "In 2013, the State of Israel awarded the Government of Liberia fifteen (15) short term training opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilateral Cooperation between Liberia and Israel culminated into the signing of several Agreements as follow::\n",
      "Technical Cooperation Agreement signed on 25 June 1962 in Jerusalem, Israel.\n",
      "Trade Agreement signed on 25 June 1962 in Jerusalem, Israel.\n",
      "Agreement on the Establishment and Operation of Air Services signed on 26 September 1972 in Jerusalem, Israel.\n",
      "In 1983, the two countries concluded a Memorandum of Understanding for cooperation in various fields including infrastructure development and aviation.  An Israeli private company Jonah International obtained contract for the construction of a new National Defense Building in return for a forest concession.\n",

      "TALKING POINTS:\n",
      "\n",
      "After the normal exchange of pleasantries, Your Excellency may wish to elaborate on the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "Extol the long standing relationship subsisting between Liberia and Israel. It would be worthy to emphasize the historic role of Liberia in the global affirmation of the statehood of the State of Israel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recall the historic exchanges of numerous visits at the highest levels between the two countries which resulted into the signing of several communiqué demonstrated by the ongoing cordial ties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mention Israel's support to peace and stability in Liberia, as well as support given through the United Nations (UN) and other international bodies.\n",
      "Express appreciation to the Government of Israel for the efforts to strengthen bilateral cooperation with Liberia evidenced by the accreditation of an Ambassador near our capital. You can assure that modalities are in the works to designate a reciprocal representation in Israel as well. \n",
      "You can acknowledge the enthusiasm and hard work of the Israeli Ambassador accredited to Liberia for igniting the momentum in our relations in a short period since receiving his Letter of Credentials.\n",
      "Express Liberia’s desire to reactivate bilateral agreements signed between our two countries, and to explore new areas interest for enhancing cooperation.\n",
      "Emphasize on development in agriculture, infrastructure, roads, security (intelligence), ports, energy and telecommunications. Liberia now needs the kind of investment that will create jobs and expand the economy on a sustainable basis. \n",
      "There is much to be learnt from Israel; extend an invitation to Israelis investment and investors, particularly, in the agriculture sector, to participate in the country's development drive. Your Excellency may recall the positive impact of AGRIMECO in boosting the economy and rural development, as well as the creation of jobs in Liberia during 1960s-1980s.\n",
      "You can seek partnership with the Israelis for the expansion of CARI and the rehabilitation and operation of Clay Youth Agriculture Training Center. Cooperation with these entities will leverage the arable land advantage of Liberia in the sub-region.\n",
      "During a meeting with the Israeli Ambassador in early May, 2016, emphasis was placed on the need for Israeli private sector intervention in the energy sector taking into consideration the overall energy deficit even after the completion of the Mount Coffee Hydro Plant.  \n",
      "Emphasize that your Government’s agenda for doing business is anchored on value addition especially in agriculture, fisheries, and oil palm, coffee, cocoa, and mining sectors, which can create more jobs to address youth unemployment.\n",
      "Mention the progress made by the Liberian Government in maintaining 15 years of peace in Liberia.\n",
      " Reaffirm Liberia's support for regional and International peace and security, democracy and good governance, and respect for human rights, as was demonstrated during the historic transition in January 2018. \n",
      "Encourage the Government of Israel to support Liberia’s Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) sector where Israel has been immensely contributing in other West African countries. \n",
      "\n",
      "Reiterate that Liberia is concerned about regional security; especially, in the face of increased terrorist attack in the sub-region occasioned by the end of mission of UNMIL in Liberia;\n",
      "You may want to aver that security cooperation with Israel will be critical to buttress our security readiness following the ongoing UNMIL transition.  Advanced training could be provided for our Emergency Response Unit of the Liberia National Police as well as the Executive Protection Service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Israel has a strong Diaspora engagement program that is immensely contributing to the growth of Israeli economy. You may want to inform about Liberia’s Diaspora engagement initiative and seek cooperation in this regard. We will like to model our program behind Israel’s wherein they can share experience with Liberia in developing our Diaspora program.\n",
      "Your Excellency may seek for support to Liberia Human Resource Development by the provision of scholarships and other short term training for Liberia's health and agriculture personnel. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, you can wish the President/Prime Minister good health and best wishes, and for the people of Israel, political and economic cohesion and prosperity.\n",

      "\n",
      "Let us all kindly stand and observe a moment of silence in remembrance of our great sons and daughters of Sierra Leone, Liberia, the Mano River Union and Africa who died as a result of the Coronavirus Pandemic that has engulfed our world.…… I THANK YOU. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me seize this opportunity, on behalf of the Government and People of Liberia, to extend heartiest congratulations to Your Excellency President Bio and the Government and hospitable people of the Republic of Sierra Leone for this milestone achievement.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have come to Freetown, Sierra Leone, not as a “guest” but a family member; to join in the joyous celebration of a historic event which also signifies this nation’s victory in its struggle for self-determination, after decades of colonial rule. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\t2\n",
      "The commonality of the sequence of events leading to the founding of our respective countries and the deep cultural and linguistic cohesion between our two countries and peoples is the glue that binds and strengthens the ties subsisting between our two Governments and peoples.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sierra Leone’s remarkable journey as a free and independent country bears great resemblance with Liberia. Envisaged as a haven for freed slaves and freed men of color from the so-called New World, both countries were thrust into an experiment of western-domination and governance, alien to the cultural practices of the indigenes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, Liberia and Sierra Leone have a long history of friendly ties.  The strong relations between our two sisterly nations have been profoundly rooted on the basis of African solidarity. \n",
      "\n",
      "Over the years, our two countries and peoples have had similar challenges and have shared similar experiences in resolving potential conflicts and creating the necessary roadmaps to peace and development. \n",

      "\n",
      "I am also here today to celebrate the transformative leadership my brother and friend President Bio has brought to this great country which is experiencing an unprecedented level of national development and progress. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sixty years of existence as an independent country is no easy feat. \n",
      "It took blood and sweat, sacrifices, sound leadership, compromises, fervent prayers; but above all, the resilience of the great people of Sierra Leone who endured so much, and are uncompromising in their collective resolve to build a nation anchored on peace, stability, freedom and democracy, human rights and the rule of law. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, it is pleasing to note that Liberia will continue to deepen its collaboration and partnership with Sierra Leone in the areas of peace building and security; as well as in the fight against illicit drugs and child trafficking.  My government assures you of its continuous cooperation in the promotion of border security, trade and commerce. As Peace, security, unity and harmony are prerequisites for the development of any nation, let us continue to rededicate ourselves to our partnership in the pursuit of these noble objectives for our Mano River Union Basin, our sub-region, our continent and the world at large. \n",
      " \n",
      "Recent developments in the global community; especially the Coronavirus (COVID 19) Pandemic have tested our leadership and made all too obvious the resounding need for multilateralism. Mutuality of vulnerability is being witnessed by both rich and poor countries alike. While the international community seems to be working in one accord to combat this COVID 19 Pandemic, I want to call on all our people; especially in the Mano River Union Basin, to be vigilant in our individual responsibility to eradicate this pandemic.\n",
      "4\n",
      "I need not expound of the economic ramifications of the COVID 19 Pandemic to our both countries. To stay afloat as a nation and provide quality services and cater to the wellbeing of our respective populations amidst the debilitating and cascading effects of COVID 19, requires an uncommon leadership. This, my brother and friend, President Bio has demonstrated and continues to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, Liberia and Sierra Leone have been on this path before with the advent of the EBOLA Virus disease. Even though we garnered some experiences in fighting back through our response mechanisms, nothing ever prepared us for the COVID 19 Pandemic. At least, we are fighting back albeit with challenges. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I wish you my brother and friend Your Excellency President Julius Maada Bio continued good health and personal well-being as you lead your Government and steer the ship of state of the Republic of Sierra Leone to nobler heights; and the Great People of Sierra Leone my endless love as we all continue to relentlessly endeavor to a brighter and prosperous future. And it is also my ardent hope that relations between our two countries and great peoples will be further deepened for the betterment of our two countries and peoples. LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC OF SIEERA LEONE; LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA; LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC OF COTE d’IVOIRE, LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA, LONG LIVE THE MANO RIVER UNION; LONG LIVE ECOWAS, LONG LIVE THE AFRICAN UNION AND LONG LIVE THE UNITED NATIONS. \n",

      "\n",
      "I am honored to have been given this opportunity to make a modest contribution to the discussions at this historic first Paris Peace Forum.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In this regard, I would like to share my views on the importance of peace and security to international stability and the growth and development of nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without peace, the world can never be stable.  Peace is an essential element for global advancement, and provides a positive framework for international cooperation and the enhancement of global trade and commerce.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is therefore incumbent upon all nations, if we are to establish a new world order where peace prevails, to seek to resolve conflicts through dialogue, negotiations, and mediation, rather than war.  The time for war is over.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is why we should take a new look at the international alliances that we form.  Nations join with other like-minded nations to protect their common interests, and to promote the collective welfare of their peoples.  And this is a good thing, because in unity there is strength, and the whole can become larger than the sum of its individual constituents.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, one of the fundamental assumptions of such alliances is that “the enemy of my friend is my enemy”, and therefore an external threat to one member is a threat to all members.  In my view, this is not always necessarily the case, and therefore it is important to review each situation in context, to determine whether there is indeed a common threat that requires a common response.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many times, the unintended consequence of group action against a perceived threat to one of its members, is that some of the other nations in the alliance may become highly vulnerable to terrorism and other acts of indirect retaliation, for which they may not have the resources or expertise to protect themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is therefore important that the international community should give serious consideration to changing the paradigm for resolving differences and threats, by moving away from military action as a primary option, to conflict resolution by non-violent means.  \n",
      "\n",
      "While military force can be used to counter a military threat, it cannot, on its own, resolve profound underlying political, social, economic and governance problems or create sustainable peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is only through peace-building efforts, including diplomacy, dialogue, negotiation, mediation, and participation, that we will be able to meet Sustainable Development Goal #16: to “promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It is through our success as global and national peace-builders that we will be able to achieve social and economic justice, reconciliation among and between our respective countries and peoples, enhance our individual and collective security, and provide the conducive environment for sustainable development.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must therefore concentrate on -- and invest in – peace-building and conflict prevention as an urgent and central priority, if we are to create a safer and more prosperous world.\n",
      "On this note, I am delighted to once more engage with other actors of global governance, and exchange views on the way forward for international peace and prosperity for all.\n",

      "\n",
      "However, we recognize that there have been many challenges in the past twelve (12) months; challenges with housing, welfare, logistics, compulsory savings, and other issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Commander-in-Chief, I have been personally engaged in the search for lasting solutions to these challenges.  I have visited the military base where, incidentally, I once lived with my uncle, Robert Bobowleh Wulateh Wreh, and have engaged in direct dialogues with the officers and men and women in arms, with the aim of hearing from them, in an open forum, about their concerns and needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of these and other interactions with members of the military at various levels, many of these concerns are now being addressed.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we have begun the renovation of existing military barracks to facilitate de-congestion of the current facilities.  Additionally, we will seek further support from Government to modernize and expand the barracks with paved roads and proper sports and recreational facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a lighter note, during one of these visits, the military invited the Cabinet, to play a friendly football match, thinking perhaps that they could their military tactics to the soccer pitch for an easy win.  However, they failed to reckon with the fact that the Captain of the Cabinet team was Africa’s first and only Ballon d’Or winner, and they paid for that mistake with a 3 - 0 loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have also deployed new equipment and hardware, such as armored personal carriers, to give our military personnel protected and efficient mobility.\n",

      "\n",
      "Yesterday, we completed our final inspection of the hospital,  which was most satisfactory.  And so I am pleased to inform you today that the 14 Military Hospital is nearing completion, and will soon be dedicated and fully operational, to cater to the critical health needs of our servicemen and women and their families, as well as the citizens living in nearby communities.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I therefore hereby instruct the Minister of National Defense and the Chief of Staff of the AFL to begin the immediate development of a policy framework for the re-activation of the Armed Forces Agriculture Company. This should also  include the identification and assessment of all lands belonging to the Armed Forces of Liberia, that are arable and feasible for agriculture productivity.\n",

      "The welfare of our troops remains a priority of this Government, and in this regard we feel a duty and an obligation to ensure that the children of military families receive a quality education.\n",
      "\n",
      "I therefore hereby direct the Minister of Defense, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, to work out modalities for the immediate renovation of all schools within our military barracks, and to develop the necessary plans to consolidate these schools  under a single district, to be named the “Armed Forces of Liberia School District”.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Under these arrangements, qualified administrators and instructors will be provided and supervised by the Ministry of Defense, and monitored by the Ministry of Education.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We will continue to engage our bilateral partners to support our efforts in the revitalization of the new Agriculture Company, and the consolidation of our military schools. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are proud of the versatility of our Armed Forces, and the diversity of skill sets and capabilities to be found among its membership.  Through the Army Corps of Engineers, they have participated in civil works of all kinds, including the construction of their own barracks, as well as the 14 Military Hospital.  They have launched massive clean-up campaigns across the length and breadth of our country.   And they are now going to be actively involved in our agricultural programs.\n",

      "Each Armed Forces Day is celebrated under a theme carefully selected to align future training needs and requirements of the AFL.   The theme for this year’s celebration, “Strategies to Incorporate More Females in the Security Sector; AFL in Perspective”, coincides with our Government’s Pro-Poor Agenda with regards to women empowerment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Female representation in both public and private sectors of our country is very low, and the AFL is no exception.  Indeed, this is reflective of the global situation, where women representation in government and the private sector is also low, with but a very few exceptions.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As Liberia’s Feminist-in-Chief, I have set my Government on an irreversible path to break this glass ceiling. We have made more appointments of women in leadership in our Government than ever before, including the first female Deputy Chief of Staff of the AFL, and promise to do more in the coming years. \n",

      "\n",
      "As Commander-in-Chief, I have been personally engaged in the search for lasting solutions to these challenges.  I have visited the military base where, incidentally, I once lived with my uncle, Robert Bobowleh Wulateh Wreh, and have engaged in direct dialogues with the officers and men and women in arms, with the aim of hearing from them, in an open forum, about their concerns and needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of these and other interactions with members of the military at various levels, many of these concerns are now being addressed.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we have begun the renovation of existing military barracks to facilitate de-congestion of the current facilities.  Additionally, we will seek further support from Government to modernize and expand the barracks with paved roads and proper sports and recreational facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a lighter note, during one of these visits, the military invited the Cabinet, to play a friendly football match, thinking perhaps that they could their military tactics to the soccer pitch for an easy win.  However, they failed to reckon with the fact that the Captain of the Cabinet team was Africa’s first and only Ballon d’Or winner, and they paid for that mistake with a 3 - 0 loss.\n",

      "\n",
      "Yesterday, we completed our final inspection of the hospital,  which was most satisfactory.  And so I am pleased to inform you today that the 14 Military Hospital is nearing completion, and will soon be dedicated and fully operational, to cater to the critical health needs of our servicemen and women and their families, as well as the citizens living in nearby communities.\n",

      "We will continue to engage our bilateral partners to support our efforts in the revitalization of the new Agriculture Company, and the consolidation of our military schools. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are proud of the versatility of our Armed Forces, and the diversity of skill sets and capabilities to be found among its membership.  Through the Army Corps of Engineers, they have participated in civil works of all kinds, including the construction of their own barracks, as well as the 14 Military Hospital.  They have launched massive clean-up campaigns across the length and breadth of our country.   And they are now going to be actively involved in our agricultural programs.\n",

The theme for this year’s celebration, “Strategies to Incorporate More Females in the Security Sector; AFL in Perspective”, coincides with our Government’s Pro-Poor Agenda with regards to women empowerment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Female representation in both public and private sectors of our country is very low, and the AFL is no exception.  Indeed, this is reflective of the global situation, where women representation in government and the private sector is also low, with but a very few exceptions.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As Liberia’s Feminist-in-Chief, I have set my Government on an irreversible path to break this glass ceiling.

      "\n",
      "As Visitor, it is incumbent upon me to use my good offices as President to ensure that the Nation’s highest institution of learning is well established, adequately funded through budgetary support from the Government, and properly managed by competent administrators.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It is given to me as my Presidential duty, to appoint the President and members of the Board of Trustees of the University, who, in turn, are mandated to engage professors and other members of the teaching staff who have earned high standards of academic qualifications, so that students enrolled at this University will receive a quality education, that will enable them to become productive in their chosen fields upon graduation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides these official functions, I am personally concerned that the University should be run smoothly and efficiently, so that it is enabled to concentrate on its growth and development plans, and fulfill its ambitions to become one of the best universities in Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "One such example of this concern is that, over the years, we have observed that students of  the University of Liberia have suffered from standing in long queues, delays in the registration processes, lack of systems to effectively and efficiently manage students` records, and to adequately manage the University’s  Administration and its system in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a student body of close to 40,000 students, it had been extremely difficult to efficiently manage the registration and administrative processes of the University on a manual basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we are all aware, there have been many instances when the registration processes have ended in riots, conflicts and demonstrations on the campuses of the University.\n",
      "In 2017, the UL Administration made a decision to digitize the University of Liberia.  But up to the time that I took Office in January of this year, the project had not yet been started.\n",
      "\n",
      "Realizing the critical importance of digitization to the smooth and efficient running of the University, I gave the project maximum priority and budgetary support at the very beginning of my Administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was my pleasure to visit your Fendall Campus on the 4th of this month, to dedicate the new digital system.  It is now installed, and in use, providing not only ease of registration, but also vital internet access so critical for research and study.\n",

      "However, in my continuous dialogues and conversations with administrators as well as students, I have been made acutely aware of another major problem facing the student body.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me tell you a story:\n",
      "\n",
      "Last Friday, I heard that students were chanting again in front of my Office.  I asked, “What is happening?”  I was told that it was the UL students, again.  So, I sent for them.  The students told me that the Administration had increased the tuition per credit hour.  I was not happy about that, So, I sent for the “Professor” here, Norris Tweah.  This is the man who speaks for the University.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Norris came and said, Mr. President, we did not increase tuition.  The tuition is still $4.00 USD per credit hour.  But if you want to pay in Liberian Dollars, the rate is 150LD to $$1.00 USD.  He said this is because of the fluctuation in the rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the main thing I was concerned about was not the rate.  I was shocked when he told me that every semester about 20,000 students go through the billing process; yet, only about 12,000 students actually attend and pay.  Furthermore, about 5,000 of the 12,000 students who are in attendance are dependent on some form of financial aid or scholarship.  He also said that the other 8,000 who enroll, but do not attend, are simply unable to find the means to pay their fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, even those students who manage to somehow pay their fees for a few semesters eventually run out of sources of funds, and are forced to drop out of school, or do not graduate in time, some of them taking as long as seven to ten years to get their first degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later in my office, Norris, Minister McGill, and myself, discussed the possibility of paying for tuition for all the 20,000 students at the University of Liberia.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, I didn’t stop there.  I invited Norris to my residence on Saturday evening to discuss this matter further, and brought in the Minister of Finance to join the discussions.  Minister Tweah, Minister McGill, Norris, and I spent nearly three hours doscussing how to help all university students in Liberia.\n",
      "So, you see, Norris Tweah is my friend.  Even though we don’t come from the same political party, but we were able to amicably discuss a great idea about solving a big problem together to benefit all of you students.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us give Norris Tweah a big round of applause!!!\n",

      "This is indeed a very sad and troubling situation, and has a direct and negative impact on our young people, and their ability to make a positive contribution to the nation’s growth and development.  By this time it should be clear to all, that we will never be successful in achieving the goals of our Pro-Poor Agenda if we do not place more emphasis on the development of our human capital.  And in so doing, we have to invest in quality education. \n",
      "\n",
      "I believe in education.  As the late Kofi Annan once said, and I quote:  \n",
      "\n",
      "“Knowledge is power. Information is liberating. Education is the premise of progress, in every society, and in every family.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the increasing cost of education in Liberia, leading to non-enrollment, non-attendance, and frequent drop-outs, is becoming counter-productive to  our development goals.  I believe, therefore, that the time has come to take  bold initiatives and make direct social interventions to address this problem.  There is a definite link between a well-educated citizenry and economic growth, and in recognition of that, my Government has decided to invest in our human capital in order to achieve sustained economic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I therefore wish to announce that my Government will pay for up to a maximum of 15 credit hours for ALL students enrolled in undergraduate courses at the University of Liberia, as well as other public universities in Liberia. \n",
      "\n",
      "The details and modalities will be arranged and finalized between the Administration of the University and the relevant sectoral Ministries of Government.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, to the students: Let me inform you that  this will be a win-win partnership between you and Government, as you will still be expected to pay all other fees charged by the University.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ladies and Gentlemen:\n",
      "\n",
      "By this intervention, my Government shows its commitment not only to invest in physical capital, such as roads, but in human capital, for the over-all growth of our citizens and our economy.  We believe that no country can develop without investing in the education of its people.  This policy will continue to form an integral part of our Pro-Poor Agenda for Development and Prosperity.\n",

      "Now there is no need for you not to enroll in school,  and for you not to attend your classes. There is also no reason now for you to drop out of school because of financial constraints.\n",

      "The infected person is Mr. Nathaniel Blama, Executive Director of the Environmental Protection Agency, who arrived in Liberia on Brussels Airlines on Friday night, the 13th of March.

      "\n",
      "Any other persons who attempt to by-pass screening at any port of entry will be arrested and taken into compulsory quarantine.\n",

There is no need to panic.  I ask that all of you should remain calm, and report any suspicious medical behavior to the authorities for our own safety.\n",

      "\n",

      "I am delighted to be here today at this 2019 Awards Ceremony of the Confederation of African Football, which is held every year to recognize the best achievers of African Football of the previous season.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we are all aware, for the first time in CAF Awards history, a special and historic feature of this year’s Awards Ceremony is the honoring of every CAF Player of the Year title holder since the establishment of this annual recognition in 1988.  I recall with fond memories that I was a proud recipient of this title in 1995.\n",
      "\n",
      "In accepting this honor, I would first of all like to thank my fans, without whom I would not be standing here today.  It is their steadfast support and loyalty that encouraged and inspired me to always try to rise to their expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I have long since retired from professional football, hung up my jersey for good, and placed my boots in permanent storage in a cupboard, I still share with all of you here today the deep love that we all have for “the beautiful game”.  Even at my age, I still find time every week to play recreationally, and I continue to follow keenly all aspects of the game in all its manifestations, issues, trends, and development.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On reflection, I have observed the stark reality that, this great game of football that we enjoy and follow, has a very short life-span for its players, especially those of us who come from Africa.  We come from a contnent with brilliant talent, but very limited opportunities to exploit that talent for our own professional growth and development.  We therefore find it necessary to leave our homes in search of a better opportunities in Europe, where the game is richly rewarded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of us were fortunate to gain fame and fortune, and to live a life that we ourselves could have never imagined.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, no matter how successful we may have been of living our dreams, the harsh reality is that the dream has a very short life.  Our careers are over by the age of 35 - 36 years.  If you are as lucky as Roger Milla, you will possibly enter your 40's.  As football professionals, we retire just when other careers are just beginning to mature and rise to higher levels of success.\n",
      "\n",
      "My question this evening to you Legends, and to all would-be Legends, is to ask whether you are prepared for, or are preparing for, a life after football.  As professional players, we are trained to work as a team, to be focused, disciplined, fair, respectful, etc.  All of these same unique character traits and attributes should make us dominate the next phase of our journey.  And if we are not equipped with the skill sets that will ensure viability and relevance after football, then it is never too late to recognize that, and to do something pro-active about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was at that same crossroads after my professional career ended.  And when I realized that I was not fully equipped with the educational foundation that I needed to find a place in the post-football world, I made the difficult decision to go back to school.   It was not an easy thing to do...being in school at the same time as your children...but the effort was worth it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I re-entered high school and graduated, and then went on to successfully complete college and graduate school, before embarking on a new career in business and politics. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is never too late to re-set your life and your career prospects.  The path may not always be clear.  And the outcome may not always be certain.  But it is important that you summon the courage, pray for strength and divine guidance, and then take the decision to act in the best interest of your future.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, in closing, I would like to thank CAF for this recognition, and to congratulate my fellow honorees for this achievement.\n",

      "Your Excellency, during that visit, I was able to observe at first hand the tremendous growth and progress of the Chinese economy under the leadership of President Xi, and was extremely impressed with the success of his poverty-reduction program, which also coincides with our own objectives in Liberia under our Pro-Poor Agenda for Development and Progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you have mentioned in your Remarks, the eight (8) new major initiatives proposed by President Xi at the recent FOCAC, designed to build a closer China-Africa community with a shared future, and adopted by the member countries of FOCAC, are remarkably similar to the goals and objectives of our Pro-Poor Agenda. \n",

      "\n",
      "I am also simultaneously humbled, and proud, that you have chosen to confer upon me, on this occasion, the Degree of Doctor  of Humane Letters, (L. H. D. Honoris Causa), for which I thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I accept this accolade with deep humility, bearing in mind that it represents a recognition and acknowledgment of the modest role that I have been privileged to play, in giving care and support to many people less fortunate than me, but who were just as deserving of getting a fighting chance to win in this lottery that we call “life”. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, I take pride in being robed in the academicals of Cuttington University, an institution for which I have had a life-long admiration, for being in the vanguard of higher education in our country for almost six decades now.  During all that time, it has educated, trained, and equipped generations of Liberians with the knowledge and skill-sets that have allowed them to compete with the best in the world, and to play leading and meaningful roles in the leadership and development of Liberia. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel a further affinity with Cuttington, when I look back and recall the dozens of scholarships that I have given to support so many students through the years who have passed through these halls, including many in the present student body, and even some members of the Class of 2018 who are graduating today.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I want to take this opportunity to thank the Faculty, Administration, and Staff, for the excellent work that you do, in spite of the many challenges that you face, and the many personal sacrifices that you make for this worthy cause.  You are our un-sung heroes, and our country owes you a debt of gratitude that can never be fully repaid.\n",
      "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\n",
      "\n",
      "Barely six months ago, Liberians went to the polls and participated in Presidential and Legislative elections, the results of which represented a tectonic shift in the underlying fundamentals of the Liberian political dynamic.  In an orderly, lawful, and peaceful manner, Liberians voted in overwhelming numbers, not just for a change of administration, but for a change of regime.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In a quiet and determined way, they exercised their franchise to bring about a Change for Hope, and voted for a change in governance that would restore hope to the underprivileged, the poor, and the traditionally disadvantaged in our society, whose needs and aspirations had never been given appropriate priority and attention by previous administrations.  \n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the long campaign, when the results were announced after the  run-off, it became clear that the pendulum had swung in the direction of youthful leadership, and that the paradigm had shifted in favor of change and transformation. \n",
      "\n",
      "As Standard Bearer of the winning Coalition for Democratic Change, the mantle and responsibility of leading this transformation devolved upon me, when I was inaugurated as the 24th President of Liberia on January 22, 2018.  The challenges of leadership are enormous, but in each and every one of these challenges, I see opportunities to make things better, and to bring permanent improvements to the lives of all Liberians.  This will take time.  As they say, Rome was not built in one day.  And therefore expectations will have to be managed, and Liberians will have to exercise patience, as we devise policies and programs that will have a lasting and positive impact on the lives of our citizens. \n",
      "\n",
      " One of the most important umbrella programs under which we intend to pursue prosperity is the Pro-Poor Agenda for Development and Progress.  This is not an Agenda only for the poor; it is for the benefit of all Liberians.  But it is a policy framework that gives priority to the alleviation of poverty, and its core objective and focus is to reduce the marginalization of the disadvantaged and the underprivileged, whilst at the same time creating a conducive atmosphere for the middle and upper income Liberian to grow and prosper.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the implementation and management of the Pro-Poor Agenda, I will have to take certain bold initiatives in order to bring about the change and transformation that we desire.  Some of these initiatives represent new strategic approaches to development, and some of them are tried and tested formulas for nation-building.  But they all are designed to work together to lift Liberia and Liberians to a higher standard of living.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transformation entails change, and not everyone is comfortable with change.  Many people take comfort In the status-quo, and find it re-assuring in its constancy.  But this attitude represents a false narrative, because change is inevitable.  The one single constancy in life is change; without which there can be no growth, no development, and no progress for mankind.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And change does not come without risk.  Even though these risks may be calculated, they are risks, nevertheless.  But one must be brave enough to take risks in the interest of progress.  And this I am prepared to do as I endeavor to chart a new course for Liberia, going forward.  In this endeavor, I pray that the God that we all know and serve, will guide and direct my path, and, in this regard, I ask for your prayers, your patience, and your support.\n",

      "AND NOW, TO THE GRADUATES:\n",
      "\n",
      "My question to you today, as you exit the safety of these halls of academia to enter the real world of challenges and opportunities, is: ARE YOU PREPARED TO TAKE THOSE RISKS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR YOU TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE IN YOUR OWN LIVES AND IN SOCIETY?\n",
      "\n",
      "Those of you who are poised to receive degrees today, are the beneficiaries of many years of the best education that Liberia can offer.  Two years of pre-school, 8 years of junior and senior high school, and 4 years of college make for a total of 14 years of study for an undergraduate; and when one adds this to the 2 to 4 years of post-graduate studies; we arrive at 16 to 20 years of sustained effort for our Masters Degree Program graduates.  So, for an average of 18 years, your minds have been fed constantly with knowledge, and you have drunk from the fountains of wisdom; and from today onwards you will be acknowledged by society as GRADUATES. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, it takes many years to become a college graduate, for indeed education is not an event, but a very long process. And, as we all know and have experienced in various ways,  the journey can be fraught with problems and difficulties and setbacks.  You will have heard, from the Citation just read to me, of my own long and difficult quest for knowledge, characterized by long periods of interruption away from the classroom, due to circumstances entirely beyond my control.  Yet, realizing that education is the key to personal development, I was determined to derive this benefit for myself.  That is why, regardless of my fame and fortune, I returned to the classroom as an adult to complete what I had not had the opportunity to do in my youthful years.  I knew then, that I was doing the right thing, and today I have no regrets for successfully pursuing and completing my academic career.\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t\n",
      "DEAR GRADUATES:\n",
      "\n",
      "I have observed from the program that there are 704 of you who will receive degrees today, including almost 200 Master’s Degrees.   As impressive as this number is, you represent but a very few fortunate persons when viewed against the backdrop of the millions of your fellow compatriots who have not had this opportunity, and who may never get this opportunity unless we all work together to create and sustain their pathway to progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are you going to do with these degrees?  You have acquired skills here that give you the potential to build successful lives and careers for yourself and for others.  Do you have the passion in your heart to go the extra mile to excel at whatever you do and achieve your personal best?  \n",
      "\n",
      "What kind of citizens are you prepared to become after today?  Pro-active?  Or re-active.  Are you prepared to get out of your comfort zone and take those risks that will enable you to leverage these qualifications to the maximum benefit of your country?  Or are you only prepared to sit on the sidelines and make the minimum effort just to get by.  Will you sit on the fence as a do-nothing observer and offer only destructive criticisms of well-meaning people who are trying to build a better Liberia, or will you bring constructive suggestions to the table that can move Liberia forward?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I would like to tell you today, Graduates, that you cannot expect extraordinary results from ordinary efforts.  Be prepared, always, to make extraordinary efforts to achieve your goals.  You can make a difference in Liberia.  But only if you take the risk of acting beyond the ordinary.  Take action, and do not be afraid to fail\n",
      "\n",
      "J.K. Rowlings, in her commencement speech at Harvard University in 2008, said, and I quote: “It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all - in which case, you fail by default.”\n",

      "\n",
      "May his soul rest in perfect peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today I want to speak to you on the topic: “YOUR LEGACY”. \n",
      "\n",
      "Webster dictionary defines legacy as “something transmitted by or received from an ancestor or predecessor or from the past.”  \n",
      "\n",
      "Using that definition, you may immediately think to yourself:  What have we received from ancestors and from those who have preceded us?  \n",
      "\n",
      "For many of you, your answer may vary from the critical to the negative. For others, it may be a legacy of courage, strength and perseverance.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Both of you would be right.  Liberia has indeed been left a legacy that is different and complex.  It is within these complexities, however, that we must learn, grow and succeed.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Today,  I want to speak to you not only about the legacy that we have all inherited from our long and checkered history as a Nation and a People, but to also turn your thoughts to what legacy YOU will leave in your turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may think: “Legacy???  I’m too young to think about Legacy.  I am just getting started in creating my own life.    I am more concerned and worried about my future, and what it holds.  Should I be thinking about legacy at this time?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, to that I say, you will make choices today that will shape your future, and the choices you make will indeed determine your legacy. You see, “legacy” isn’t something you achieve by One Great Action, One Great Success, or One Great Failure.  Your future, your “legacy”, is the sum of many small decisions you will make throughout your life.\n",
      "\n",
      "As new graduates, and young people, you are often referred to as future leaders, but I take a different view.  You are not future leaders.... you are leaders NOW!  In your communities, in your villages, in your group of friends, in your families, and places of work.\n",
      "There are many people that you know, who have not had the privilege of receiving higher education, as you have been fortunate to do.  You are one of a very tiny minority compared to the rest of our population.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So you have no time to waste in putting your newly acquired skill-sets and knowledge to work as leaders, wherever you are.  You CAN,  and MUST,  begin NOW, to contribute to the dialogue and the narrative that will define YOUR present, and shape YOUR tomorrow. \n",
      "\n",
      "There is a well-known hymn, which begins with these words: “I know not what the future hath, of marvel or surprise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking inspiration from that thought, I would like to say to you today, that \n",
      "\n",
      "YOU MAY NOT KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS, BUT YOU CAN USE THE PRESENT TO SHAPE IT.  AND THOSE WHO SHAPE THE FUTURE, WILL OWN IT.\n",
      "\n",
      "I repeat:  \n",
      "You may not know what the future holds, but you can use the present to shape it.  And those who shape the future, will own it.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\n",
      "\n",
      "We are in the midst of a paradigm shift in the Liberian political dispensation, when the torch of leadership has been passed on to a new and younger generation.  There is no longer a significant generation gap between those who lead and those who are led.   With this new phenomenon comes the reality that WE have the COLLECTIVE power to shape the new Liberia, and with this power comes a great responsibility. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is no longer enough for you to expect others to find solutions and make changes.  It is time, as graduates, that you begin to think, and to ask yourselves:  what problems of our beloved nation can I help to solve, as I leave these Halls and enter the real world?I encourage each of you to be solution seekers and problem solvers. Your education here at the University of Liberia has prepared you to go out in the world and find solutions.  How many times have you creatively come up with solutions to problems during your pursuit of this achievement? \n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe it was no lights to study for a test, so you studied using your phone; maybe you missed lectures and worked out with a friend the how, where and when to get notes or homework; maybe it was a subject you did not understand, and you decided to tutor another student in exchange for help with that subject.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe, just maybe, it was a final paper or exam that you needed to do well on, and you worked out a solution to get  “assistance” or even for someone to do it for you.\n",

      "\t\t\n",
      "\n",

      "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\n",
      "On a more serious note, maybe it was the lack of money to pay exam fees\n",
      "\n",
      "[look at audience and pause]\n",
      "\n",
      "Thankfully, you will be the last class that will have to come up with solutions to that particular problem, because this Administration is committed to support our students in public universities and colleges through the payment of tuition fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Graduates, you MUST be solutions-oriented. Our country is in a phase of rebuilding.  The legacy left by years of war, and political and financial corruption, is the destruction of our infrastructure, the devastation of our economy and the erosion of our ethical, moral, and social values.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Solutions are needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "As members of this New Generation, to whom the torch of leadership has been passed, we (and I mean we as in ALL OF US, including YOU) are faced with an urgent need for a restoration of our infrastructure, our economy, and our ethical, moral, and social values.   There is also an urgent need to create new economic opportunities for all Liberians.  This is our common task, for BOTH the leaders AND the led, and we must commit ourselves to this transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, I ask:  what will be the legacy of your generation?  What will you leave, for your children, or your families? What legacy will you help to create for this and other generations of Liberians?  \n",
      "\n",
      "Together, WE are writing the history of our country.  It is indeed a great time to be able to contribute to the change, and to be a part of a new creative and innovative approach as to how we can shape the future.  \n",
      "\n",
      "During your time here at the University of Liberia, you have not only acquired employable skills, but you have also learned how to think critically.  Along the way, your sense of commitment and determination has been tried, tested, and proven.  You have persevered through difficult challenges. \n",
      "The the knowledge and values that you have acquired from the many academic disciplines offered by this University, are important to help you improve the prospects of your own lives, as well as those of your family, and that of your country.   Use these skills and values as your guiding principles in solving problems to build your legacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dare to take a different path to seek solutions. As you go into the world, choose dialogue and negotiation, over protest and violence, to find solutions.  Seek peaceful and lawful methods of problem-solving and conflict resolution.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Today, you are enjoying the dividends of dialogue; the positive results of taking a different path.  You will recall that I personally intervened on a number of occasions since my incumbency, and invited protestors, many of whom were students from this University, off the streets and into my office. Together, our dialogue and negotiations led to peaceful and beneficial solutions.  \n",
      " For example:  Your digitalization project was funded and completed in a timely manner, and today, you have the benefit of on-line access to registration, grades, class schedules, and a more efficient business management tool for the University Administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "You complained of a lack of adequate sanitary facilities on your Capitol Hill campus, and, in very short order, this inconvenience was resolved with the construction of new bathrooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "More importantly, your complaints about inability to pay tuition fees were resolved with the landmark, historical decision of my Administration to make all public universities tuition-free.\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
      "We, together, chose peaceful dialogue as a different path, and together, we arrived at practical and beneficial solutions.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I admonish you, as the NEW leaders of Liberia, to continue on the path of peaceful dialogue, without roadblocks, riots and civil commotion, to address grievances.   The outcome to such disruptive tactics can be unpredictable. Be courageous to stand and state your grievances.  And assist in the search for peaceful solutions. This will build your legacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pick one of the problems Liberia still struggles with and courageously commit to making a difference.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we still struggle with issues of gender violence and inequality.  What are you doing to eradicate this issue? Be courageous.  Take a stand.  Show your support for the efforts being made by the Administration to address this cancer in our society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me give you another example to make my point.  We still have a problem of a lack of availability of reliable electricity for all.  This is an age-old problem that we have all inherited.  It goes back more than 40 years.  So how do we solve it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We, as a Government, are fully focused on the solution, moving forward, re-visiting, re-working, re-wiring.  The aim is to reach every community eventually, every citizen.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Protests, such as the recent ones in connection with this issue, are NOT discouraged.  Citizens need to have a voice about the issues that adversely affect them.   \n",
      "\n",
      "But this voice can be heard without creating barricades and setting fires to them.  Your right and freedom to call attention to your legitimate grievances should not infringe upon the rights and freedoms of other law-abiding citizens, or cause them unnecessary inconvenience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Graduates, it is important that you know this universal truth…. success in ANYTHING is a PROCESS.  Do not expect overnight solutions or results.  You have a right to dream bigger, to expect more than those before you, but you should also know that dreams are not immediately realized. You will have to work, and try, and fail, and learn the lessons of your failure, and have the courage to try yet again. \n",
      "\n",
      "Achieving success is a process.  Finding solutions is a process. \n",
      "You want to own your own business, it’s a process. You want a big job, it’s a process.  You want to be a star, it’s a process. You want changes in the country, it’s a process.  You want to be President, [pause and look to the audience for the answer] it’s a process.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "So begin to work NOW on the legacy you will leave. Liberia is ready for problem solvers!  Africa is ready for solution seekers!  The world is ready for fresh, new and creative ideas!  NOW!\n",

      "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me quickly share a personal story with you. As I grew up in the ghetto of Gibraltar in Monrovia, I was always aware of this shining place of learning on this Hill, called the University of Liberia.  I hung around many friends whose parents could afford the fees for them to attend, and I would soon see them registered and attending what we used to call, at that time, “LU”. Oh, how I envied them.  \n",
      "\n",
      "But “LU” was beyond my reach, because I could not find the cash flow that would allow me to stay in a high school long enough for me to matriculate there.  And then the opportunity came for me to make a better living as a footballer, and I realized that I had reached a crossroads in my life: I had to make a choice between school, and work.  But the path was not clear.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As I told the graduates during the Cuttington commencement recently, the path will not always be clear.  But you have to take personal decisions sometimes between alternatives, and then take responsibility for those decisions.  Once you have made them, you must do all that you can to ensure that it was the right decision.  Make it happen, or take responsibility for any negative consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had already reached the 12th grade, but I made the decision to become a professional player for just a few short years in Cameroun, and to use my earnings and savings to return to Liberia to complete my high school education, so I could finally enroll in this wonderful LU.  But God had other plans for me, and, as they say, the rest is history.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I still had this special love and respect for the University of Liberia.  Therefore, when my career gave me enough financial success, I decided to put that love and respect into action and quietly provided financial support and scholarships, so that other students could have an opportunity where I did not.  I share this story with you not for personal praise, but as a challenge to each of you to do your part.  \n",
      "\n",
      "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t\n",

      "Je me considère maintenant un ancien élève de l’Université!\n",
      "Ora considero un alumno di questa Università!\n",
      "As such, I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to highlight an area of responsibility, which is another mark you can leave as your legacy.  Your support of this organization of higher learning is needed.  Today, you graduate.  It is not the end of your relationship with this Institution.  It is, in fact, the beginning of your responsibility as an alumnus. \n",
      " \n",
      "And now, I am going to call on you, my fellow alumni, to be a formidable collective force for supporting our University financially, no matter how small your individual contributions may be.  By so doing, a part of the legacy we will leave, will be an institution that continues to provide the highest quality  education for succeeding generations.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Now let me raise a challenge to the Alumni Association leadership:  \n",
      "You must take on a new vigor, and directly engage the thousands of graduates who passed through these hallowed halls.  Set up a database of alumni, and let us establish an Endowment Fund for our Alma Mater.  In this regard, you can call on me anytime, as your newest member, for my fullest support.\n",
